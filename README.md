## Quick Start

### One Command for Everything (IDE Installation)

**Just run one of these commands:**

```bash
npx bmad-method install
```

The interactive installer will guide you through:

1. **Project location** - Where to install BMad
2. **Module selection** - Choose which modules you need (BMM, BMB, CIS)
3. **Configuration** - Set your name, language preferences, and module options
   - **Game Development (Optional)**: When installing BMM, you can optionally include game development agents and workflow!
4. **IDE integration** - Configure your development environment

### What Gets Installed

All modules install to a single `bmad/` folder in your project:

```
your-project/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ bmad/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ core/         # Core framework (always installed)
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ bmm/          # BMad Method (if selected)
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ bmb/          # BMad Builder (if selected)
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ cis/          # Creative Intelligence Suite (shared resources)
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ _cfg/         # Your customizations
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ agents/   # Agent customization files
```

### Getting Started with BMM

After installation, activate the Analyst agent in your IDE and run:

```bash
/workflow-init
```

Or run it directly as a command (command syntax varies by IDE - use slash commands in Claude Code, OpenCode, etc.).

This sets up the guided workflow system and helps you choose the right starting point for your project based on its complexity.
