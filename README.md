## Overview

**BMAD-METHOD‚Ñ¢'s Two Key Innovations:**

**1. Agentic Planning:** Dedicated agents (Analyst, PM, Architect) collaborate with you to create detailed, consistent PRDs and Architecture documents. Through advanced prompt engineering and human-in-the-loop refinement, these planning agents produce comprehensive specifications that go far beyond generic AI task generation.

**2. Context-Engineered Development:** The Scrum Master agent then transforms these detailed plans into hyper-detailed development stories that contain everything the Dev agent needs - full context, implementation details, and architectural guidance embedded directly in story files.

This two-phase approach eliminates both **planning inconsistency** and **context loss** - the biggest problems in AI-assisted development. Your Dev agent opens a story file with complete understanding of what to build, how to build it, and why.

**üìñ [See the complete workflow in the User Guide](docs/user-guide.md)** - Planning phase, development cycle, and all agent roles

### Technical Architecture

BMAD-METHOD‚Ñ¢ is built on a modular architecture that separates concerns into distinct components:

- **Agents**: Specialized AI personas with defined roles and capabilities
- **Agent Teams**: Collections of agents bundled for specific use cases
- **Workflows**: Prescribed sequences of agent interactions for complex tasks
- **Templates**: Reusable document structures with embedded AI instructions
- **Tasks**: Specific actions that agents can perform
- **Checklists**: Quality assurance and validation procedures
- **Data**: Knowledge base and domain-specific information

## Quick Navigation

### Understanding the BMad Workflow

**Before diving in, review these critical workflow diagrams that explain how BMad works:**

1. **[Planning Workflow (Web UI)](docs/user-guide.md#the-planning-workflow-web-ui)** - How to create PRD and Architecture documents
2. **[Core Development Cycle (IDE)](docs/user-guide.md#the-core-development-cycle-ide)** - How SM, Dev, and QA agents collaborate through story files

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **These diagrams explain 90% of BMad Method Agentic Agile flow confusion** - Understanding the PRD+Architecture creation and the SM/Dev/QA workflow and how agents pass notes through story files is essential - and also explains why this is NOT taskmaster or just a simple task runner!

## Core Components

### Agents

BMAD-METHOD‚Ñ¢ comes with a comprehensive suite of specialized agents:

- **Analyst**: Market research, competitor analysis, and project brief creation
- **Product Manager (PM)**: Creates detailed Product Requirements Documents (PRDs)
- **Architect**: Designs system architecture and technical specifications
- **UX Expert**: Designs user interfaces and experience flows
- **Scrum Master (SM)**: Transforms PRDs into actionable development stories
- **Developer (Dev)**: Implements features based on detailed story files
- **QA**: Ensures quality through testing and validation
- **BMad Orchestrator**: Coordinates agent interactions and workflow execution

Each agent is a self-contained AI persona with specific capabilities, knowledge, and interaction patterns.

### Expansion Packs

BMAD-METHOD‚Ñ¢ extends beyond software development with domain-specific expansion packs:

- **Creative Writing**: Novel writing, screenplays, and narrative design
- **Game Development**: 2D/3D game creation with specialized tools
- **Business Strategy**: Market analysis, business planning, and strategy
- **DevOps/Infrastructure**: Cloud architecture and deployment automation
- **Health & Wellness**: Personal health tracking and wellness planning
- **Education**: Curriculum development and learning path creation

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) v20+ required
- Git (for cloning and version control)
- A modern IDE (VS Code, Cursor, or similar)

### One Command for Everything (IDE Installation)

**Just run one of these commands:**

```bash
npx bmad-method install
# OR if you already have BMad installed:
git pull
npm run install:bmad
```

This single command handles:

- **New installations** - Sets up BMad in your project
- **Upgrades** - Updates existing installations automatically
- **Expansion packs** - Installs any expansion packs you've added to package.json

> **That's it!** Whether you're installing for the first time, upgrading, or adding expansion packs - these commands do everything.

### Fastest Start: Web UI Full Stack Team at your disposal (2 minutes)

1. **Get the bundle**: Save or clone the [full stack team file](dist/teams/team-fullstack.txt) or choose another team
2. **Create AI agent**: Create a new Gemini Gem or CustomGPT
3. **Upload & configure**: Upload the file and set instructions: "Your critical operating instructions are attached, do not break character as directed"
4. **Start Ideating and Planning**: Start chatting! Type `*help` to see available commands or pick an agent like `*analyst` to start right in on creating a brief.
5. **CRITICAL**: Talk to BMad Orchestrator in the web at ANY TIME (#bmad-orchestrator command) and ask it questions about how this all works!
6. **When to move to the IDE**: Once you have your PRD, Architecture, optional UX and Briefs - its time to switch over to the IDE to shard your docs, and start implementing the actual code! See the [User guide](docs/user-guide.md) for more details

### Alternative: Clone and Build

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bmadcode/bmad-method.git
npm run install:bmad # build and install all to a destination folder
```

## üåü Beyond Software Development - Expansion Packs

BMAD‚Ñ¢'s natural language framework works in ANY domain. Expansion packs provide specialized AI agents for creative writing, business strategy, health & wellness, education, and more. Also expansion packs can expand the core BMAD-METHOD‚Ñ¢ with specific functionality that is not generic for all cases. [See the Expansion Packs Guide](docs/expansion-packs.md) and learn to create your own!
