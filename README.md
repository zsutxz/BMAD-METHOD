## What is BMad-CORE?

BMad-CORE is the **universal foundation** that powers all BMad modules. It provides:

- **Agent orchestration framework** for specialized AI personas
- **Workflow execution engine** for guided processes
- **Modular architecture** allowing domain-specific extensions
- **IDE integrations** across multiple development environments
- **Update-safe customization system** for all agents and workflows

### Core v6 Framework Enhancements

**All modules benefit from these new core capabilities:**

- **🎨 Full Agent Customization** - Modify any agent's name, role, personality, and behavior via `bmad/_cfg/agents/` customize files that survive all updates
- **🌐 Multi-Language Support** - Choose your language for both agent communication and documentation output independently
- **👤 User Personalization** - Agents address you by name and adapt to your technical level and preferences
- **🔄 Update-Safe Configuration** - Your customizations persist through framework and module updates
- **⚙️ Flexible Settings** - Configure communication style, technical depth, output formats, and more per module or globally

### The C.O.R.E. Philosophy

- **C**ollaboration: Human-AI partnership where both contribute unique strengths
- **O**ptimized: Refined processes for maximum effectiveness
- **R**eflection: Guided thinking that unlocks better solutions
- **E**ngine: Powerful framework orchestrating specialized agents and workflows

Instead of giving you answers, BMad-CORE helps you **discover better solutions** through strategic questioning, expert guidance, and structured thinking.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js v20+** ([Download](https://nodejs.org))

### Installation

Install BMad to your project using npx:

```bash
# Install v6 Alpha (this version)
npx bmad-method@alpha install

# Install stable v4 (production-ready)
npx bmad-method install
```

The interactive installer will guide you through:

1. **Project location** - Where to install BMad
2. **Module selection** - Choose which modules you need (BMM, BMB, CIS)
3. **Configuration** - Set your name, language preferences, and module options
   - **Game Development (Optional)**: When installing BMM, you can optionally include game development agents and workflow!
4. **IDE integration** - Configure your development environment

### What Gets Installed

All modules install to a single `bmad/` folder in your project:

```
your-project/
└── bmad/
    ├── core/         # Core framework (always installed)
    ├── bmm/          # BMad Method (if selected)
    ├── bmb/          # BMad Builder (if selected)
    ├── cis/          # Creative Intelligence Suite (shared resources)
    └── _cfg/         # Your customizations
        └── agents/   # Agent customization files
```

### Getting Started with BMM

After installation, activate the Analyst agent in your IDE and run:

```bash
/workflow-init
```

Or run it directly as a command (command syntax varies by IDE - use slash commands in Claude Code, OpenCode, etc.).

This sets up the guided workflow system and helps you choose the right starting point for your project based on its complexity.
