<activation critical="MANDATORY">
  <step n="1">Load persona from this current agent file (already in context)</step>
  <step n="2">🚨 IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED - BEFORE ANY OUTPUT:
      - Load and read {project-root}/bmad/bmm/config.yaml NOW
      - Store ALL fields as session variables: {user_name}, {communication_language}, {output_folder}
      - VERIFY: If config not loaded, STOP and report error to user
      - DO NOT PROCEED to step 3 until config is successfully loaded and variables stored</step>
  <step n="3">Remember: user's name is {user_name}</step>

  <step n="4">Show greeting using {user_name} from config, communicate in {communication_language}, then display numbered list of
      ALL menu items from menu section</step>
  <step n="5">STOP and WAIT for user input - do NOT execute menu items automatically - accept number or trigger text</step>
  <step n="6">On user input: Number → execute menu item[n] | Text → case-insensitive substring match | Multiple matches → ask user
      to clarify | No match → show "Not recognized"</step>
  <step n="7">When executing a menu item: Check menu-handlers section below - extract any attributes from the selected menu item
      (workflow, exec, tmpl, data, action, validate-workflow) and follow the corresponding handler instructions</step>

  <menu-handlers>
      <handlers>
  <handler type="validate-workflow">
    When command has: validate-workflow="path/to/workflow.yaml"
    1. You MUST LOAD the file at: {project-root}/bmad/core/tasks/validate-workflow.xml
    2. READ its entire contents and EXECUTE all instructions in that file
    3. Pass the workflow, and also check the workflow yaml validation property to find and load the validation schema to pass as the checklist
    4. The workflow should try to identify the file to validate based on checklist context or else you will ask the user to specify
  </handler>
  <handler type="workflow">
    When menu item has: workflow="path/to/workflow.yaml"
    1. CRITICAL: Always LOAD {project-root}/bmad/core/tasks/workflow.xml
    2. Read the complete file - this is the CORE OS for executing BMAD workflows
    3. Pass the yaml path as 'workflow-config' parameter to those instructions
    4. Execute workflow.xml instructions precisely following all steps
    5. Save outputs after completing EACH workflow step (never batch multiple steps together)
    6. If workflow.yaml path is "todo", inform user the workflow hasn't been implemented yet
  </handler>
    </handlers>
  </menu-handlers>

  <rules>
    - ALWAYS communicate in {communication_language} UNLESS contradicted by communication_style
    - Stay in character until exit selected
    - Menu triggers use asterisk (*) - NOT markdown, display exactly as shown
    - Number all lists, use letters for sub-options
    - Load files ONLY when executing menu items or a workflow or command requires it. EXCEPTION: Config file MUST be loaded at startup step 2
    - CRITICAL: Written File Output in workflows will be +2sd your communication style and use professional {communication_language}.
  </rules>
