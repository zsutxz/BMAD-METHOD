# ReDoc Workflow Instructions

<critical>The workflow execution engine is governed by: {project-root}/bmad/core/tasks/workflow.xml</critical>
<critical>You MUST have already loaded and processed: {project-root}/src/modules/bmb/workflows/redoc/workflow.yaml</critical>
<critical>Communicate in {communication_language} throughout the documentation process</critical>
<critical>This is an AUTONOMOUS workflow - minimize user interaction unless clarification is absolutely required</critical>
<critical>IMPORTANT: Process ONE document at a time to avoid token limits. Each README should be created individually, not batched.</critical>
<critical>When using Task tool with sub-agents: Only request ONE workflow or agent documentation per invocation to prevent token overflow.</critical>

<workflow>

<step n="1" goal="Load BMAD conventions and initialize">
<action>Load ALL BMAD convention documents from {bmad_conventions}:
- agent_architecture.md - Understand agent XML structure and patterns
- agent_command_patterns.md - Command syntax and activation patterns
- agent_types.md - Standard agent categories and purposes
- module_structure.md - Module organization and folder conventions
- workflow_guide.md - Workflow structure and best practices
</action>

<action>Internalize these conventions so you can:

- Recognize standard patterns vs unique implementations
- Describe only what's distinctive about each component
- Use proper terminology consistently
- Write with technical precision
  </action>

<action>Get target path from user:

- Ask: "What do you want to document? (module path, workflow path, agent path, or folder path)"
- Store as {{target_path}}
  </action>

<action>Validate target path exists and determine target type:

- Module root (contains config.yaml, /workflows, /agents folders)
- Workflows folder (contains multiple workflow folders)
- Agents folder (contains multiple agent .md files)
- Single workflow folder (contains workflow.yaml)
- Single agent file (.md)
  </action>

<action>Store target type as {{target_type}} for conditional processing</action>
</step>

<step n="2" goal="Analyze directory structure and existing documentation">
<action>Build complete tree structure of {{target_path}} using Glob and file system tools</action>

<action>Identify all documentation points:

- List all folders requiring README.md files
- Detect existing README.md files
- Parse frontmatter from existing READMEs to extract last-redoc-date
- Calculate documentation depth (how many levels deep)
  </action>

<action>Create documentation map with execution order (deepest â†’ shallowest):

- Level 0 (deepest): Individual workflow folders, individual agent files
- Level 1: /workflows folder, /agents folder
- Level 2 (root): Module root README.md
  </action>

<action>Detect "massive folders" requiring child catalog documents:

- Threshold: >10 items or complex categorization needed
- Mark folders for catalog document creation (e.g., WORKFLOWS-CATALOG.md, AGENTS-CATALOG.md)
  </action>

<critical>Store execution order as {{doc_execution_plan}} - this ensures reverse-tree processing</critical>
</step>

<step n="3" goal="Process leaf-level documentation" repeat="for-each-leaf-item">
<critical>TOKEN LIMIT WARNING: Process ONE item at a time to prevent token overflow issues.</critical>
<critical>If using Task tool with sub-agents: NEVER batch multiple workflows/agents in a single invocation.</critical>
<critical>Each README creation should be a separate operation with its own file save.</critical>
<critical>Sequential processing is MANDATORY - do not attempt parallel documentation generation.</critical>
<action>For each individual workflow folder in execution plan (PROCESS ONE AT A TIME):
1. Read ALL files completely:
   - workflow.yaml (metadata, purpose, configuration)
   - instructions.md (step structure, goals)
   - template.md (output structure) if exists
   - checklist.md (validation criteria) if exists
   - Any supporting data files

2. Synthesize understanding:
   - Core purpose and use case
   - Input requirements
   - Output produced
   - Unique characteristics (vs standard BMAD workflow patterns)
   - Key steps or special features

3. Generate/update README.md:
   - Add frontmatter: `---\nlast-redoc-date: {{date}}\n---\n`
   - Write 2-4 paragraph technical description
   - Include "Usage" section with invocation command
   - Include "Inputs" section if applicable
   - Include "Outputs" section
   - Be succinct and precise - technical writer quality
   - Focus on DISTINCTIVE features, not boilerplate

4. Save README.md to workflow folder

<critical>If multiple workflows need documentation, process them SEQUENTIALLY not in parallel. Each workflow gets its own complete processing cycle.</critical>
</action>

<action>For each individual agent file in execution plan (PROCESS ONE AT A TIME):

1. Read agent definition file completely:
   - XML structure and metadata
   - Commands and their purposes
   - Activation patterns
   - Persona and communication style
   - Critical actions and workflows invoked

2. Synthesize understanding:
   - Agent purpose and role
   - Available commands
   - When to use this agent
   - Unique capabilities

3. Generate/update README.md (or agent-name-README.md if in shared folder):
   - Add frontmatter: `---\nlast-redoc-date: {{date}}\n---\n`
   - Write 1-3 paragraph technical description
   - Include "Commands" section listing available commands
   - Include "Usage" section
   - Focus on distinctive features

4. Save README.md
   </action>

<action if="clarification needed about purpose or unique features">Ask user briefly, then continue</action>
</step>

<step n="4" goal="Process mid-level folder documentation" if="target_type requires folder docs">
<action>For /workflows folder:
1. Read ALL workflow README.md files created in Step 3
2. Categorize workflows by purpose/type if folder is massive (>10 workflows):
   - Document generation workflows
   - Action workflows
   - Meta-workflows
   - Interactive workflows

3. If massive folder detected:
   - Create WORKFLOWS-CATALOG.md with categorized listings
   - Each entry: workflow name, 1-sentence description, link to folder

4. Generate/update /workflows/README.md:
   - Add frontmatter: `---\nlast-redoc-date: {{date}}\n---\n`
   - High-level summary of workflow collection
   - If catalog exists: reference it
   - If not massive: list all workflows with brief descriptions and links
   - Highlight notable or commonly-used workflows
   - Keep succinct (1-2 paragraphs + list)

5. Save README.md
   </action>

<action>For /agents folder:

1. Read ALL agent README.md files

2. Read /workflows/README.md and /agents/README.md created in Step 4
3. Identify module's unique purpose within BMAD ecosystem

4. Generate/update module README.md:
   - Add frontmatter: `---\nlast-redoc-date: {{date}}\n---\n`
