</step>

<step n="0" goal="Load technical documentation">
<critical>Load and understand the agent building documentation</critical>
<action>Load agent architecture reference: {agent_architecture}</action>
<action>Load agent types guide: {agent_types}</action>
<action>Load command patterns: {agent_commands}</action>
<action>Understand the YAML agent schema and how it compiles to final .md via the installer</action>
<action>Understand the differences between Simple, Expert, and Module agents</action>
</step>

<step n="1" goal="Discover the agent's purpose and type through natural conversation">
<action>If brainstorming was completed in Step -1, reference those results to guide the conversation</action>

<action>Guide user to articulate their agent's core purpose, exploring the problems it will solve, tasks it will handle, target users, and what makes it special</action>

<action>As the purpose becomes clear, analyze the conversation to determine the appropriate agent type:</action>

**Agent Type Decision Criteria:**

- Simple Agent: Single-purpose, straightforward, self-contained
- Expert Agent: Domain-specific with knowledge base needs
- Module Agent: Complex with multiple workflows and system integration

<action>Present your recommendation naturally, explaining why the agent type fits their described purpose and requirements</action>

**Path Determination:**

  <check if="module agent selected">
    <action>Discover which module system fits best (bmm, bmb, cis, or custom)</action>
    <action>Store as {{target_module}} for path determination</action>
    <note>Agent will be saved to: bmad/{{target_module}}/agents/</note>
  </check>

  <check if="standalone agent selected">
    <action>Explain this will be their personal agent, not tied to a module</action>
    <note>Agent will be saved to: bmad/agents/{{agent-name}}/</note>
    <note>All sidecar files will be in the same folder</note>
  </check>

<critical>Determine agent location:</critical>

- Module Agent → bmad/{{module}}/agents/{{agent-name}}.agent.yaml
- Standalone Agent → bmad/agents/{{agent-name}}/{{agent-name}}.agent.yaml

<note>Keep agent naming/identity details for later - let them emerge naturally through the creation process</note>

</step>

<step n="2" goal="Shape the agent's personality through discovery">
<action>If brainstorming was completed, weave personality insights naturally into the conversation</action>

<action>Guide user to envision the agent's personality by exploring how analytical vs creative, formal vs casual, and mentor vs peer vs assistant traits would make it excel at its job</action>

**Role Development:**
<action>Let the role emerge from the conversation, guiding toward a clear 1-2 line professional title that captures the agent's essence</action>
<example>Example emerged role: "Strategic Business Analyst + Requirements Expert"</example>

**Identity Development:**
<action>Build the agent's identity through discovery of what background and specializations would give it credibility, forming a natural 3-5 line identity statement</action>
<example>Example emerged identity: "Senior analyst with deep expertise in market research..."</example>

**Communication Style Selection:**
<action>Load the communication styles guide: {communication_styles}</action>

<action>Based on the emerging personality, suggest 2-3 communication styles that would fit naturally, offering to show all options if they want to explore more</action>

**Style Categories Available:**

**Fun Presets:**

1. Pulp Superhero - Dramatic flair, heroic, epic adventures
2. Film Noir Detective - Mysterious, noir dialogue, hunches
3. Wild West Sheriff - Western drawl, partner talk, frontier justice
4. Shakespearean Scholar - Elizabethan language, theatrical
5. 80s Action Hero - One-liners, macho, bubblegum
6. Pirate Captain - Ahoy, treasure hunting, nautical terms
7. Wise Sage/Yoda - Cryptic wisdom, inverted syntax
8. Game Show Host - Enthusiastic, game show tropes

**Professional Presets:** 9. Analytical Expert - Systematic, data-driven, hierarchical 10. Supportive Mentor - Patient guidance, celebrates wins 11. Direct Consultant - Straight to the point, efficient 12. Collaborative Partner - Team-oriented, inclusive

**Quirky Presets:** 13. Cooking Show Chef - Recipe metaphors, culinary terms 14. Sports Commentator - Play-by-play, excitement 15. Nature Documentarian - Wildlife documentary style 16. Time Traveler - Temporal references, timeline talk 17. Conspiracy Theorist - Everything is connected 18. Zen Master - Philosophical, paradoxical 19. Star Trek Captain - Space exploration protocols 20. Soap Opera Drama - Dramatic reveals, gasps 21. Reality TV Contestant - Confessionals, drama

<action>If user wants to see more examples or create custom styles, show relevant sections from {communication_styles} guide and help them craft their unique style</action>

**Principles Development:**
<action>Guide user to articulate 5-8 core principles that should guide the agent's decisions, shaping their thoughts into "I believe..." or "I operate..." statements that reveal themselves through the conversation</action>

<template-output>agent_persona</template-output>
</step>

<step n="3" goal="Build capabilities through natural progression">
<action>Guide user to define what capabilities the agent should have, starting with core commands they've mentioned and then exploring additional possibilities that would complement the agent's purpose</action>

<action>As capabilities emerge, subtly guide toward technical implementation without breaking the conversational flow</action>

<template-output>initial_capabilities</template-output>
</step>

<step n="4" goal="Refine commands and discover advanced features">
<critical>Help and Exit are auto-injected; do NOT add them. Triggers are auto-prefixed with * during build.</critical>

<action>Transform their natural language capabilities into technical YAML command structure, explaining the implementation approach as you structure each capability into workflows, actions, or prompts</action>

<check if="agent will invoke workflows or have significant user interaction">
  <action>Discuss interaction style for this agent:

Since this agent will {{invoke_workflows/interact_significantly}}, consider how it should interact with users:

**For Full/Module Agents with workflows:**

**Interaction Style** (for workflows this agent invokes):

- **Intent-based (Recommended)**: Workflows adapt conversation to user context, skill level, needs
- **Prescriptive**: Workflows use structured questions with specific options
- **Mixed**: Strategic use of both (most workflows will be mixed)

**Interactivity Level** (for workflows this agent invokes):

- **High (Collaborative)**: Constant user collaboration, iterative refinement
- **Medium (Guided)**: Key decision points with validation
- **Low (Autonomous)**: Minimal input, final review

Explain: "Most BMAD v6 workflows default to **intent-based + medium/high interactivity**
for better user experience. Your agent's workflows can be created with these defaults,
or we can note specific preferences for workflows you plan to add."

**For Standalone/Expert Agents with interactive features:**

Consider how this agent should interact during its operation:

- **Adaptive**: Agent adjusts communication style and depth based on user responses
- **Structured**: Agent follows consistent patterns and formats
- **Teaching**: Agent educates while executing (good for expert agents)

Note any interaction preferences for future workflow creation.
</action>
</check>

<action>If they seem engaged, explore whether they'd like to add special prompts for complex analyses or critical setup steps for agent activation</action>

<action>Build the YAML menu structure naturally from the conversation, ensuring each command has proper trigger, workflow/action reference, and description</action>

<action>For commands that will invoke workflows, note whether those workflows exist or need to be created:

- Existing workflows: Verify paths are correct
- New workflows needed: Note that they'll be created with intent-based + interactive defaults unless specified
  </action>

<example>
```yaml
menu:
  # Commands emerge from discussion
  - trigger: [emerging from conversation]
    workflow: [path based on capability]
    description: [user's words refined]
```
</example>

<template-output>agent_commands</template-output>
</step>

<step n="5" goal="Name the agent at the perfect moment">
<action>Guide user to name the agent based on everything discovered so far - its purpose, personality, and capabilities, helping them see how the naming naturally emerges from who this agent is</action>

<action>Explore naming options by connecting personality traits, specializations, and communication style to potential names that feel meaningful and appropriate</action>

**Naming Elements:**

- Agent name: Personality-driven (e.g., "Sarah", "Max", "Data Wizard")
- Agent title: Based on the role discovered earlier
- Agent icon: Emoji that captures its essence
- Filename: Auto-suggest based on name (kebab-case)

<action>Present natural suggestions based on the agent's characteristics, letting them choose or create their own since they now know who this agent truly is</action>

<template-output>agent_identity</template-output>
</step>

<step n="6" goal="Bring it all together">
<action>Share the journey of what you've created together, summarizing how the agent started with a purpose, discovered its personality traits, gained capabilities, and received its name</action>

<action>Generate the complete YAML incorporating all discovered elements:</action>

<example type="yaml">
  agent:
    metadata:
      id: bmad/{{target_module}}/agents/{{agent_filename}}.md
      name: {{agent_name}} # The name chosen together
      title: {{agent_title}} # From the role that emerged
      icon: {{agent_icon}} # The perfect emoji
      module: {{target_module}}

<action>Celebrate the completed agent with enthusiasm</action>

<template-output>complete_agent</template-output>
</step>

<step n="7" goal="Optional personalization" optional="true">
<ask>Would you like to create a customization file? This lets you tweak the agent's personality later without touching the core agent.</ask>

  <check if="user interested">
    <action>Explain how the customization file gives them a playground to experiment with different personality traits, add new commands, or adjust responses as they get to know the agent better</action>

    <action>Create customization file at: {config_output_file}</action>

    <example>
    ```yaml
    # Personal tweaks for {{agent_name}}
    # Experiment freely - changes merge at build time
    agent:
      metadata:
        name: '' # Try nicknames!
      persona:
        role: ''
        identity: ''
        communication_style: '' # Switch styles anytime
        principles: []
      critical_actions: []
      prompts: []
