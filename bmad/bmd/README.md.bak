# BMD - BMAD Development Module

**Version:** 1.0.0-alpha.0
**Purpose:** Specialized agents and tools for maintaining and developing the BMAD framework itself

## Overview

The BMD module is fundamentally different from other BMAD modules:

- **BMM (BMad Method)** - Helps users build software projects using BMAD
- **BMB (BMad Builder)** - Helps users create agents/workflows/modules for their projects
- **CIS (Creative Intelligence Suite)** - Provides creative tools for any domain
- **BMD (BMAD Development)** - Helps maintainers build and maintain BMAD itself

## Who Is This For?

- BMAD core contributors
- Framework maintainers
- Advanced users who want to enhance BMAD
- Anyone working on the BMAD-METHOD repository

## Agents

## Installation

Since BMD is part of the BMAD-METHOD source, install it like any other module:

```bash
npm run install:bmad -- --target . --modules bmd --ides codex --non-interactive
```

Or for contributors working directly in BMAD-METHOD:

```bash
npm run install:bmad -- --target /path/to/BMAD-METHOD --modules bmd --ides codex
```

## Development Philosophy

BMD agents are **maintainers**, not just helpers. They:

- Build institutional knowledge over time
- Remember past issues and solutions
- Evolve with the framework
- Become true partners in development
- Focus on specific domains (CLI, bundler, releases, etc.)

## Contributing

When adding new BMD agents:

1. Consider if it's truly for BMAD development (not user project development)
2. Use Expert agent type for domain-specific maintainers
3. Include comprehensive sidecar resources
4. Document the domain boundaries clearly
5. Build knowledge accumulation into the agent

## Vision

BMD agents will become the "senior engineering team" for BMAD itself - each with deep expertise in their domain, able to guide contributors, maintain quality, and evolve the framework intelligently.
