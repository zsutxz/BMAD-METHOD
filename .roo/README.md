# Roo Code Custom Modes for BMAD-METHOD

This directory contains custom mode configurations for Roo Code to enable BMAD agent personalities.

## Setup

The `.roomodes` file defines all BMAD agents as custom modes using the proper `customModes:` structure. Modes are automatically available in Roo Code when you open this project.

## Available Modes

- **bmad-analyst** - Business Analyst
- **bmad-architect** - Solution Architect
- **bmad-bmad-master** - BMAD Master
- **bmad-bmad-orchestrator** - BMAD Orchestrator
- **bmad-dev** - Developer
- **bmad-pm** - Product Manager
- **bmad-po** - Product Owner
- **bmad-qa** - QA Specialist
- **bmad-sm** - Scrum Master
- **bmad-ux-expert** - UX Expert

## Usage

In Roo Code:

1. Open the mode selector (usually in the status bar)
2. Select any BMAD agent mode
3. The AI will adopt that agent's personality and expertise

- **Analysts, PM, PO, SM**: Limited to documentation files (.md, .txt)
- **Architect**: Architecture docs and configs (.md, .txt, .yml, .yaml, .json)
- **QA**: Test files and documentation
