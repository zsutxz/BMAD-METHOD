      optional_steps:
        - brainstorming_session
        - market_research_prompt
      notes: "Can do brainstorming first, then optional deep research before creating project brief. SAVE OUTPUT: Copy final project-brief.md to your project's docs/ folder."

    - agent: pm
      creates: prd.md
      requires: project-brief.md
      notes: "Creates PRD from project brief using prd-tmpl, focused on API/service requirements. SAVE OUTPUT: Copy final prd.md to your project's docs/ folder."

      creates: architecture.md
      requires: prd.md
      optional_steps:
        - technical_research_prompt
      notes: "Creates backend/service architecture using architecture-tmpl. May suggest changes to PRD stories or new stories. SAVE OUTPUT: Copy final architecture.md to your project's docs/ folder."

    - agent: pm
      updates: prd.md (if needed)
      requires: architecture.md
      condition: architecture_suggests_prd_changes
      notes: "If architect suggests story changes, update PRD and re-export the complete unredacted prd.md to docs/ folder."

  decision_guidance:
    when_to_use:
      - Building production APIs or microservices
      - Multiple endpoints and complex business logic
      - Need comprehensive documentation and testing
      - Multiple team members will be involved
      - Long-term maintenance expected
      - Enterprise or external-facing APIs
