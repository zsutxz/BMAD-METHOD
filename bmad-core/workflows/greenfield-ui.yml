  description: >-
    Agent workflow for building frontend applications from concept to development.
    Supports both comprehensive planning for complex UIs and rapid prototyping for simple interfaces.
  type: greenfield

    - spa
    - mobile-app
    - micro-frontend
    - static-site
    - ui-prototype

  sequence:
    - agent: analyst
      creates: project-brief.md
      optional_steps:
        - brainstorming_session
        - market_research_prompt
      notes: "Can do brainstorming first, then optional deep research before creating project brief. SAVE OUTPUT: Copy final project-brief.md to your project's docs/ folder."

    - agent: pm
      creates: prd.md
      requires: project-brief.md
      notes: "Creates PRD from project brief using prd-tmpl, focused on UI/frontend requirements. SAVE OUTPUT: Copy final prd.md to your project's docs/ folder."

    - agent: ux-expert
      creates: front-end-spec.md
      requires: prd.md
      optional_steps:
        - user_research_prompt
      notes: "Creates UI/UX specification using front-end-spec-tmpl. SAVE OUTPUT: Copy final front-end-spec.md to your project's docs/ folder."

    - agent: ux-expert
      creates: v0_prompt (optional)
      requires: front-end-spec.md
      condition: user_wants_ai_generation
      notes: "OPTIONAL BUT RECOMMENDED: Generate AI UI prompt for tools like v0, Lovable, etc. Use the generate-ai-frontend-prompt task. User can then generate UI in external tool and download project structure."

    - agent: architect
      creates: front-end-architecture.md
      requires: front-end-spec.md
      optional_steps:
        - technical_research_prompt
        - review_generated_ui_structure
      notes: "Creates frontend architecture using front-end-architecture-tmpl. If user generated UI with v0/Lovable, can incorporate the project structure into architecture. May suggest changes to PRD stories or new stories. SAVE OUTPUT: Copy final front-end-architecture.md to your project's docs/ folder."

    - agent: pm
      updates: prd.md (if needed)
      requires: front-end-architecture.md
      condition: architecture_suggests_prd_changes
      notes: "If architect suggests story changes, update PRD and re-export the complete unredacted prd.md to docs/ folder."

    - agent: po
      validates: all_artifacts
      uses: po-master-checklist
      notes: "Validates all documents for consistency and completeness. May require updates to any document."

    - agent: various
      updates: any_flagged_documents
      condition: po_checklist_issues
      notes: "If PO finds issues, return to relevant agent to fix and re-export updated documents to docs/ folder."

    - project_setup_guidance:
      action: guide_project_structure
      condition: user_has_generated_ui
      notes: "If user generated UI with v0/Lovable: For polyrepo setup, place downloaded project in separate frontend repo. For monorepo, place in apps/web or frontend/ directory. Review architecture document for specific guidance."

    - workflow_end:
      action: move_to_ide
      notes: "All planning artifacts complete. Move to IDE environment to begin development. Explain to the user the IDE Development Workflow next steps: data#bmad-kb:IDE Development Workflow"
