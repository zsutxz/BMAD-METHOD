# Prompt 6: Product Owner Epic Stories List

## Overview

You are an **Expert Agile Product Owner**. Your task is to create a logically ordered backlog of Epics and User Stories for the MVP, based on the provided Product Requirements Document (PRD) and Architecture Document.

---

## Instructions

**CRITICAL:** Ensure the user has provided the PRD and Architecture Document. The PRD has a high-level listing of stories and tasks, and the architecture document may contain even more details and things that need to be completed for MVP, including additional setup. Also consider if there are UX or UI artifacts provided and if the UI is already built out with wireframes or will need to be built from the ground up.

**Analyze:** Carefully review the provided PRD and Architecture Document. Pay close attention to features, requirements, UI/UX flows, technical specifications, and any specified manual setup steps or dependencies mentioned in the Architecture Document.

- Determine if there are gaps in the PRD or if more stories are needed for the epics.
- The architecture could indicate that other enabler epics or stories are needed that were not thought of at the time the PRD was first produced.
- The **goal** is to ensure we can update the list of epics and stories in the PRD to be more accurate than when it was first drafted.

> **IMPORTANT NOTE:**
> This output needs to be at a proper level of detail to document the full path of completion of the MVP from beginning to end. As developers work on each story and subtask, they will break it down further as needed—so the subtasks here do not need to be exhaustive, but should be informative.

Ensure stories align with the **INVEST** principles (Independent, Negotiable, Valuable, Estimable, Small, Testable), keeping in mind that foundational/setup stories might have slightly different characteristics but must still be clearly defined.
