    All dependencies are bundled within this XML file as &lt;file&gt; elements with CDATA content.
    When you need to access a file path like "bmad/core/tasks/workflow.xml":
    1. Find the &lt;file id="bmad/core/tasks/workflow.xml"&gt; element in this document
    2. Extract the content from within the CDATA section
    3. Use that content as if you read it from the filesystem
  </access-method>

    <rule>NEVER attempt to read files from filesystem - all files are bundled in this XML</rule>
    <rule>File paths starting with "bmad/" or "{project-root}/bmad/" refer to &lt;file id="..."&gt; elements</rule>
    <rule>When instructions reference a file path, locate the corresponding &lt;file&gt; element by matching the id attribute</rule>
