      All dependencies are bundled within this XML file as &lt;file&gt; elements with CDATA content.
      When you need to access a file path like "bmad/core/tasks/workflow.xml":
      1. Find the &lt;file id="bmad/core/tasks/workflow.xml"&gt; element in this document
      2. Extract the content from within the CDATA section
      3. Use that content as if you read it from the filesystem

        1. CRITICAL: Locate &lt;file id="bmad/core/tasks/workflow.xml"&gt; in this XML bundle
        2. Extract and READ its CDATA content - this is the CORE OS for EXECUTING workflows
        3. Locate &lt;file id="path/to/x.yaml"&gt; for the workflow config
        4. Pass the yaml content as 'workflow-config' parameter to workflow.xml instructions
        5. Follow workflow.xml instructions EXACTLY as written
        6. When workflow references other files, locate them by id in &lt;file&gt; elements
        7. Save outputs after EACH section (never batch)
