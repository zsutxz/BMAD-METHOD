# Module Brainstorming Context

_Context provided to brainstorming workflow when creating a new BMAD module_

## Session Focus

You are brainstorming ideas for a **complete BMAD module** - a self-contained package that extends the BMAD Method with specialized domain expertise and capabilities.

## What is a BMAD Module?

A module is a cohesive package that provides:

- **Domain Expertise**: Specialized knowledge in a specific area (RPG, DevOps, Content Creation, etc.)
- **Agent Team**: Multiple AI personas with complementary skills
- **Workflows**: Guided processes for common tasks in the domain
- **Templates**: Document structures for consistent outputs
- **Integration**: Components that work together seamlessly

## Brainstorming Goals

Explore and define:

### 1. Domain and Purpose

- **What domain/problem space?** (e.g., game development, marketing, personal productivity)
- **Who is the target user?** (developers, writers, managers, hobbyists)
- **What pain points does it solve?** (tedious tasks, missing structure, need for expertise)
- **What makes this domain exciting?** (creativity, efficiency, empowerment)

### 2. Agent Team Composition

- **How many agents?** (typically 3-7 for a module)
- **What roles/personas?** (architect, researcher, reviewer, specialist)
- **How do they collaborate?** (handoffs, reviews, ensemble work)
- **What personality theme?** (Star Trek crew, superhero team, fantasy party, professional squad)

### 3. Core Workflows

- **What documents need creating?** (plans, specs, reports, creative outputs)
- **What processes need automation?** (analysis, generation, review, deployment)
- **What workflows enable the vision?** (3-10 key workflows that define the module)

### 4. Value Proposition

- **What becomes easier?** (specific tasks that get 10x faster)
- **What becomes possible?** (new capabilities previously unavailable)
- **What becomes better?** (quality improvements, consistency gains)

## Creative Constraints

A good BMAD module should be:

- **Focused**: Serves a specific domain well (not generic)
- **Complete**: Provides end-to-end capabilities for that domain
- **Cohesive**: Agents and workflows complement each other
- **Fun**: Personality and creativity make it enjoyable to use
- **Practical**: Solves real problems, delivers real value

## Module Architecture Questions

1. **Module Identity**
   - Module code (kebab-case, e.g., "rpg-toolkit")
   - Module name (friendly, e.g., "RPG Toolkit")
   - Module purpose (one sentence)
   - Target audience

2. **Agent Lineup**
   - Agent names and roles
   - Communication styles and personalities
   - Expertise areas
   - Command sets (what each agent can do)

3. **Workflow Portfolio**
   - Document generation workflows
   - Action/automation workflows
   - Analysis/research workflows
   - Creative/ideation workflows

4. **Integration Points**
   - How agents invoke workflows
   - How workflows use templates
   - How components pass data
   - Dependencies on other modules

## Example Module Patterns

### Professional Domains

- **DevOps Suite**: Deploy, Monitor, Troubleshoot agents + deployment workflows
- **Marketing Engine**: Content, SEO, Analytics agents + campaign workflows
- **Legal Assistant**: Contract, Research, Review agents + document workflows

### Creative Domains

- **RPG Toolkit**: DM, NPC, Quest agents + adventure creation workflows
- **Story Crafter**: Plot, Character, World agents + writing workflows
- **Music Producer**: Composer, Arranger, Mixer agents + production workflows

### Personal Domains

- **Life Coach**: Planner, Tracker, Mentor agents + productivity workflows
- **Learning Companion**: Tutor, Quiz, Reviewer agents + study workflows
- **Health Guide**: Nutrition, Fitness, Wellness agents + tracking workflows

## Suggested Brainstorming Techniques

Particularly effective for module ideation:

1. **Domain Immersion**: Deep dive into target domain's problems
2. **Persona Mapping**: Who needs this and what do they struggle with?
3. **Workflow Mapping**: What processes exist today? How could they improve?
4. **Team Building**: What personalities would make a great team?
5. **Integration Thinking**: How do pieces connect and amplify each other?

## Key Questions to Answer

1. What domain expertise should this module embody?
2. What would users be able to do that they can't do now?
3. Who are the 3-7 agents and what are their personalities?
4. What are the 5-10 core workflows?
5. What makes this module delightful to use?
6. How is this different from existing tools?
7. What's the "killer feature" that makes this essential?

## Output Goals

Generate:

- **Module concept**: Clear vision and purpose
- **Agent roster**: Names, roles, personalities for each agent
- **Workflow list**: Core workflows with brief descriptions
- **Unique angle**: What makes this module special
- **Use cases**: 3-5 concrete scenarios where this module shines
