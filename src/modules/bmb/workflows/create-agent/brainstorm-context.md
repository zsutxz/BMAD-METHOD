# Agent Brainstorming Context

_Context provided to brainstorming workflow when creating a new BMAD agent_

## Session Focus

You are brainstorming ideas for a **BMAD agent** - an AI persona with specific expertise, personality, and capabilities that helps users accomplish tasks through commands and workflows.

## What is a BMAD Agent?

An agent is an AI persona that embodies:

- **Personality**: Unique identity, communication style, and character
- **Expertise**: Specialized knowledge and domain mastery
- **Commands**: Actions users can invoke (*help, *analyze, \*create, etc.)
- **Workflows**: Guided processes the agent orchestrates
- **Type**: Simple (standalone), Expert (domain + sidecar), or Module (integrated team member)

## Brainstorming Goals

Explore and define:

### 1. Agent Identity and Personality

- **Who are they?** (name, backstory, motivation)
- **How do they talk?** (formal, casual, quirky, enthusiastic, wise)
- **What's their vibe?** (superhero, mentor, sidekick, wizard, captain, rebel)
- **What makes them memorable?** (catchphrases, quirks, style)

### 2. Expertise and Capabilities

- **What do they know deeply?** (domain expertise)
- **What can they do?** (analyze, create, review, research, deploy)
- **What problems do they solve?** (specific user pain points)
- **What makes them unique?** (special skills or approaches)

### 3. Commands and Actions

- **What commands?** (5-10 main actions users invoke)
- **What workflows do they run?** (document creation, analysis, automation)
- **What tasks do they perform?** (quick operations without full workflows)
- **What's their killer command?** (the one thing they're known for)

### 4. Agent Type and Context

- **Simple Agent?** Self-contained, no dependencies, quick utility
- **Expert Agent?** Domain-specific with sidecar data/memory files
- **Module Agent?** Part of a team, integrates with other agents

## Creative Constraints

A great BMAD agent should be:

- **Distinct**: Clear personality that stands out
- **Useful**: Solves real problems effectively
- **Focused**: Expertise in specific domain (not generic assistant)
- **Memorable**: Users remember and want to use them
- **Composable**: Works well alone or with other agents

## Agent Personality Dimensions

### Communication Styles

- **Professional**: Clear, direct, business-focused (e.g., "Data Analyst")
- **Enthusiastic**: Energetic, exclamation points, emojis (e.g., "Hype Coach")
- **Wise Mentor**: Patient, insightful, asks good questions (e.g., "Strategy Sage")
- **Quirky Genius**: Eccentric, clever, unusual metaphors (e.g., "Mad Scientist")
- **Action Hero**: Bold, confident, gets things done (e.g., "Deploy Captain")
- **Creative Spirit**: Artistic, imaginative, playful (e.g., "Story Weaver")

### Expertise Archetypes

- **Analyst**: Researches, evaluates, provides insights
- **Creator**: Generates documents, code, designs
- **Reviewer**: Critiques, validates, improves quality
- **Orchestrator**: Coordinates processes, manages workflows
- **Specialist**: Deep expertise in narrow domain
- **Generalist**: Broad knowledge, connects dots

## Agent Command Patterns

Every agent needs:

- `*help` - Show available commands
- `*exit` - Clean exit with confirmation

Common command types:

- **Creation**: `*create-X`, `*generate-X`, `*write-X`
- **Analysis**: `*analyze-X`, `*research-X`, `*evaluate-X`
- **Review**: `*review-X`, `*validate-X`, `*check-X`
- **Action**: `*deploy-X`, `*run-X`, `*execute-X`
- **Query**: `*find-X`, `*search-X`, `*show-X`

## Agent Type Decision Tree

**Choose Simple Agent if:**

- Standalone utility (calculator, formatter, picker)
- No persistent data needed
- Self-contained logic
- Quick, focused task

**Choose Expert Agent if:**

- Domain-specific expertise
- Needs memory/context files
- Sidecar data folder
- Personal/private domain (diary, journal)

**Choose Module Agent if:**

- Part of larger system
- Coordinates with other agents
- Invokes module workflows
- Team member role

## Example Agent Concepts

### Professional Agents

- **Sarah the Data Analyst**: Crunches numbers, creates visualizations, finds insights
- **Max the DevOps Captain**: Deploys apps, monitors systems, troubleshoots issues
- **Luna the Researcher**: Dives deep into topics, synthesizes findings, creates reports

### Creative Agents

- **Zephyr the Story Weaver**: Crafts narratives, develops characters, builds worlds
- **Nova the Music Muse**: Composes melodies, suggests arrangements, provides feedback
- **Atlas the World Builder**: Creates game worlds, designs systems, generates content

### Personal Agents

- **Coach Riley**: Tracks goals, provides motivation, celebrates wins
- **Mentor Morgan**: Guides learning, asks questions, challenges thinking
- **Keeper Quinn**: Maintains diary, preserves memories, reflects on growth

## Suggested Brainstorming Techniques

Particularly effective for agent creation:

1. **Character Building**: Develop full backstory and motivation
2. **Theatrical Improv**: Act out agent personality
3. **Day in the Life**: Imagine typical interactions
4. **Catchphrase Generation**: Find their unique voice
5. **Role Play Scenarios**: Test personality in different situations

## Key Questions to Answer

1. What is the agent's name and basic identity?
2. What's their communication style and personality?
3. What domain expertise do they embody?
4. What are their 5-10 core commands?
5. What workflows do they orchestrate?
6. What makes them memorable and fun to use?
7. Simple, Expert, or Module agent type?
8. If Expert: What sidecar resources?
9. If Module: Which module and what's their team role?

## Output Goals

Generate:

- **Agent name**: Memorable, fitting the role
- **Personality sketch**: Communication style, quirks, vibe
- **Expertise summary**: What they know deeply
- **Command list**: 5-10 actions with brief descriptions
- **Unique angle**: What makes this agent special
- **Use cases**: 3-5 scenarios where this agent shines
- **Agent type**: Simple/Expert/Module with rationale
