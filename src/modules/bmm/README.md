# BMM - BMad Method Module

The BMM (BMad Method Module) is the core orchestration system for the BMad Method, providing comprehensive software development lifecycle management through specialized agents, workflows, teams, and tasks.

## üìö Essential Reading

**Before using BMM, you MUST read the [BMM v6 Workflows Guide](./workflows/README.md).** This document explains the revolutionary v6a workflow system and how all components work together.

## Module Structure

### ü§ñ `/agents`

Specialized AI agents for different development roles:

- **PM** (Product Manager) - Product planning and requirements
- **Analyst** - Business analysis and research
- **Architect** - Technical architecture and design
- **SM** (Scrum Master) - Sprint and story management
- **DEV** (Developer) - Code implementation
- **TEA** (Test Architect) - Test Architect
- **UX** - User experience design
- And more specialized roles

**Game Development Agents** (Optional):
During installation, you can optionally include game development specialists:

- **Game Designer** - Creative vision and game design documents (GDD)
- **Game Developer** - Game-specific implementation
- **Game Architect** - Game systems and technical infrastructure

These agents come with specialized workflows (`brainstorm-game`, `game-brief`, `gdd`) and are only installed if you select "Include Game Planning Agents and Workflows" during BMM installation.

### üìã `/workflows`

The heart of BMM - structured workflows for the four development phases:

1. **Analysis Phase** (Optional)
   - `brainstorm-project` - Project ideation
   - `research` - Market/technical research
   - `product-brief` - Product strategy

2. **Planning Phase** (Required)
   - `prd` - Scale-adaptive project planning
   - Routes to appropriate documentation based on project complexity

3. **Solutioning Phase** (Level 3-4 projects)
   - `3-solutioning` - Architecture design
   - `tech-spec` - Epic-specific technical specifications

4. **Implementation Phase** (Iterative)
   - `create-story` - Story drafting (SM agent)
   - `story-ready` - Approve story for development (SM agent)
   - `story-context` - Expertise injection (SM agent)
   - `dev-story` - Implementation (DEV agent)
   - `story-done` - Mark story done (DEV agent)
   - `code-review` - Quality validation (DEV/SR agent)
   - `correct-course` - Issue resolution
   - `retrospective` - Continuous improvement

### üë• `/teams`

Pre-configured agent teams for different project types and phases. Teams coordinate multiple agents working together on complex tasks.

### üìù `/tasks`

Reusable task definitions that agents execute within workflows. These are the atomic units of work that compose into larger workflows.

### üîß `/sub-modules`

Extension modules that add specialized capabilities to BMM.

### üèóÔ∏è `/testarch`

Test architecture and quality assurance components. The **[Test Architect (TEA) Guide](./testarch/README.md)** provides comprehensive testing strategy across 9 workflows: framework setup, CI/CD, test design, ATDD, automation, traceability, NFR assessment, quality gates, and test review.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Load the PM agent - either via slash command or drag and drop or @ the agent file.
# Once loaded, the agent should greet you and offer a menu of options. You can enter:
`*prd`
```

## Key Concepts

### Scale Levels

BMM automatically adapts to project complexity:

- **Level 0**: Single atomic change
- **Level 1**: 1-10 stories, minimal documentation
- **Level 2**: 5-15 stories, focused PRD
- **Level 3**: 12-40 stories, full architecture
- **Level 4**: 40+ stories, enterprise scale

### Just-In-Time Design

Technical specifications are created one epic at a time during implementation, not all upfront, allowing for learning and adaptation.

### Story State Machine

Stories flow through a 4-state lifecycle tracked in the status file:

```
BACKLOG ‚Üí TODO ‚Üí IN PROGRESS ‚Üí DONE
```

- **BACKLOG**: Ordered list of stories to be drafted (populated at phase transition)
- **TODO**: Single story ready for SM to draft (or drafted, awaiting approval)
- **IN PROGRESS**: Single story approved for DEV to implement
- **DONE**: Completed stories with dates and points

Agents never search for "next story" - they always read the exact story from the status file. Simple workflows (`story-ready`, `story-done`) advance the queue automatically.

### Context Injection

Story-specific technical guidance is generated dynamically, providing developers with exactly the expertise needed for each task.

## Integration with BMad Core

BMM integrates seamlessly with the BMad Core framework, leveraging:

- The agent execution engine
- Workflow orchestration
- Task management
- Team coordination

## Best Practices

1. **Always start with the workflows** - Let workflows guide your process
2. **Respect the scale** - Don't over-document small projects
3. **Trust the process** - The methodology has been carefully designed
