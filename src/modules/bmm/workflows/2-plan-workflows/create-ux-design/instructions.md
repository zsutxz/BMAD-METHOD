</action>

<ask>Let's identify your app's defining experience - the core interaction that, if we nail it, everything else follows.

When someone describes your app to a friend, what would they say?

**Examples:**

- "It's the app where you swipe to match with people" (Tinder)
- "You can share photos that disappear" (Snapchat)
- "It's like having a conversation with AI" (ChatGPT)
- "Capture and share moments" (Instagram)

**What's yours?** What's the ONE experience that defines your app?</ask>

<action>Analyze if this core experience has established UX patterns:

    Standard patterns exist for:
    - CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
    - E-commerce flows (Browse → Product → Cart → Checkout)
    - Social feeds (Infinite scroll, like/comment)
    - Authentication (Login, signup, password reset)
    - Search and filter
    - Content creation (Forms, editors)
    - Dashboards and analytics

    Novel patterns may be needed for:
    - Unique interaction mechanics (before Tinder, swiping wasn't standard)
    - New collaboration models (before Figma, real-time design wasn't solved)
    - Unprecedented content types (before TikTok, vertical short video feeds)

Each mockup shows a complete vision for your app's look and feel.

As you explore, look for:
✓ Which layout feels most intuitive for your users?
✓ Which information hierarchy matches your priorities?
✓ Which interaction style fits your core experience?
✓ Which visual weight feels right for your brand?

<output>I've identified {{pattern_count}} UX pattern categories that need consistent decisions across your app. Let's make these decisions together to ensure users get a consistent experience.

These patterns determine how {{project_name}} behaves in common situations - like how buttons work, how forms validate, how modals behave, etc.</output>

<ask>For each pattern category below, I'll present options and a recommendation. Tell me your preferences or ask questions.

**Pattern Categories to Decide:**

- Button hierarchy (primary, secondary, destructive)
- Feedback patterns (success, error, loading)
- Form patterns (labels, validation, help text)
- Modal patterns (size, dismiss, focus)
- Navigation patterns (active state, back button)
- Empty state patterns
- Confirmation patterns (delete, unsaved changes)
- Notification patterns
- Search patterns
- Date/time patterns

For each one, do you want to:

1. Go through each pattern category one by one (thorough)
2. Focus only on the most critical patterns for your app (focused)
3. Let me recommend defaults and you override where needed (efficient)</ask>

<action>Based on user choice, facilitate pattern decisions with appropriate depth: - If thorough: Present all categories with options and reasoning - If focused: Identify 3-5 critical patterns based on app type - If efficient: Recommend smart defaults, ask for overrides

    For each pattern decision, document:
    - Pattern category
    - Chosen approach
    - Rationale (why this choice for this app)
    - Example scenarios where it applies

<step n="9" goal="Responsive and accessibility strategy">
  <critical>Responsive design isn't just "make it smaller" - it's adapting the experience</critical>

<action>Based on platform requirements from PRD and chosen design direction:</action>

<ask>Let's define how your app adapts across devices.

Target devices from PRD: {{devices}}

For responsive design:

1. **Desktop** (large screens):
   - How should we use the extra space?
   - Multi-column layouts?
   - Side navigation?

2. **Tablet** (medium screens):
   - Simplified layout from desktop?
   - Touch-optimized interactions?
   - Portrait vs landscape considerations?

3. **Mobile** (small screens):
   - Bottom navigation or hamburger menu?
   - How do multi-column layouts collapse?
   - Touch target sizes adequate?

What's most important for each screen size?
</ask>

<action>Define breakpoint strategy:

    Based on chosen layout pattern from design direction:

    Breakpoints:
    - Mobile: {{max_width}} ({{cols}}-column layout, {{nav_pattern}})
    - Tablet: {{range}} ({{cols}}-column layout, {{nav_pattern}})
    - Desktop: {{min_width}} ({{cols}}-column layout, {{nav_pattern}})

    Adaptation Patterns:
    - Navigation: {{how_it_changes}}
    - Sidebar: {{collapse_hide_convert}}
    - Cards/Lists: {{grid_to_single_column}}
    - Tables: {{horizontal_scroll_card_view_hide_columns}}
    - Modals: {{full_screen_on_mobile}}
    - Forms: {{layout_changes}}

  </action>

<action>Define accessibility strategy:

    <ask>Let's define your accessibility strategy.

Accessibility means your app works for everyone, including people with disabilities:

- Can someone using only a keyboard navigate?
- Can someone using a screen reader understand what's on screen?
- Can someone with color blindness distinguish important elements?
- Can someone with motor difficulties use your buttons?

**WCAG Compliance Levels:**

- **Level A** - Basic accessibility (minimum)
- **Level AA** - Recommended standard, legally required for government/education/public sites
- **Level AAA** - Highest standard (not always practical for all content)

**Legal Context:**

- Government/Education: Must meet WCAG 2.1 Level AA
- Public websites (US): ADA requires accessibility
- EU: Accessibility required

Based on your deployment intent: {{recommendation}}

**What level should we target?**</ask>

    Accessibility Requirements:

    Compliance Target: {{WCAG_level}}

    Key Requirements:
    - Color contrast: {{ratio_required}} (text vs background)
    - Keyboard navigation: All interactive elements accessible
    - Focus indicators: Visible focus states on all interactive elements
    - ARIA labels: Meaningful labels for screen readers
    - Alt text: Descriptive text for all meaningful images
    - Form labels: Proper label associations
    - Error identification: Clear, descriptive error messages
    - Touch target size: Minimum {{size}} for mobile

    Testing Strategy:
    - Automated: {{tools}} (Lighthouse, axe DevTools)
    - Manual: Keyboard-only navigation testing
    - Screen reader: {{tool}} testing
