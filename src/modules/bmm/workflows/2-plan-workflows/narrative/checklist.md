# Narrative Design Workflow Validation Checklist

**Purpose**: Validate narrative design outputs are complete, cohesive, and ready for implementation.

**Scope**: Story-driven games and applications (follows GDD workflow)

**Expected Output**: narrative-design.md

---

## 1. Output File Exists

- [ ] narrative-design.md created in output folder
- [ ] GDD.md exists (narrative workflow requires GDD first)
- [ ] No unfilled {{template_variables}}

---

## 2. Story Foundation

### Core Elements

- [ ] **Narrative premise** clearly stated (elevator pitch, 2-3 sentences)
- [ ] **Core themes** identified (2-4 meaningful themes)
- [ ] **Tone and atmosphere** established
- [ ] Premise is compelling and fits game type

### Story Structure

- [ ] **Story structure chosen** (3-act, hero's journey, branching, etc.)
- [ ] **Acts/sections broken down** with clear progression
- [ ] **Major story beats** documented (key moments that drive narrative)
- [ ] Structure fits narrative complexity level

---

## 3. Characters

### Protagonist(s)

- [ ] Background and motivation explained
- [ ] Character arc defined (how they change)
- [ ] Internal and external conflicts identified

### Antagonist(s)

- [ ] Motivation clear (why they oppose protagonist)
- [ ] Goals and methods explained
- [ ] Not one-dimensional

### Supporting Cast

- [ ] Major supporting characters documented
- [ ] Each has distinct role in story
- [ ] Character relationships mapped

### Character Arcs

- [ ] Major characters have starting → transformation → ending states
- [ ] Arc progression makes sense

---

## 4. World and Lore

- [ ] **World setting** defined (time, place, world type)
- [ ] **World rules** explained (magic, technology, society)
- [ ] **History and backstory** documented
- [ ] Key locations described with narrative significance

---

## 5. Dialogue and Delivery

### Dialogue Framework

- [ ] Dialogue style established
- [ ] Key conversations identified
- [ ] Branching dialogue system described (if applicable)

### Narrative Delivery

- [ ] Cutscenes/cinematics approach defined
- [ ] In-game storytelling methods explained
- [ ] Optional vs. required content distinguished
- [ ] Multiple endings documented (if applicable)

---

## 6. Gameplay Integration

- [ ] **Narrative-gameplay harmony** addressed (how story and mechanics connect)
- [ ] **Story gates** explained (how narrative controls progression)
- [ ] **Player agency** level defined (can player affect story?)
- [ ] Integration doesn't fight game design

---

## 7. Production Scope

- [ ] **Writing scope** estimated (word count, scene count, dialogue lines)
- [ ] Scope realistic for project level
- [ ] Localization considerations noted (if applicable)
- [ ] Voice acting plans documented (if applicable)

---

## 8. Consistency with GDD

- [ ] Narrative aligns with GDD game design
- [ ] Tone matches GDD art/audio direction
- [ ] Story supports game mechanics (doesn't contradict)
- [ ] No conflicts between narrative and gameplay

---

## 9. Critical Failures (Auto-Fail)

- [ ] ❌ **No GDD** (narrative workflow requires GDD first)
- [ ] ❌ **No character arcs** (protagonist has no development)
- [ ] ❌ **No story beats** (major moments not identified)
- [ ] ❌ **Contradicts GDD** (narrative fights game design)

---

## Validation Notes

**Document any findings:**

- Narrative strength: [Compelling / Interesting / Adequate / Weak]
- Strengths:
- Issues to address:
- Recommended actions:

**Ready for solutioning?** [Yes / No - explain]

---

_Adapt based on narrative complexity level (Critical/Heavy/Moderate/Light)._
