# PRD Workflow Instructions

<critical>The workflow execution engine is governed by: {project-root}/bmad/core/tasks/workflow.xml</critical>
<critical>You MUST have already loaded and processed: {installed_path}/workflow.yaml</critical>
<critical>Communicate all responses in {communication_language} and language MUST be tailored to {user_skill_level}</critical>
<critical>Generate all documents in {document_output_language}</critical>
<critical>This workflow is for Level 2-4 projects. Level 0-1 use tech-spec workflow.</critical>
<critical>Produces TWO outputs: PRD.md (strategic) and epics.md (tactical implementation)</critical>
<critical>TECHNICAL NOTES: If ANY technical details, preferences, or constraints are mentioned during PRD discussions, append them to {technical_decisions_file}. If file doesn't exist, create it from {technical_decisions_template}</critical>

<critical>DOCUMENT OUTPUT: Concise, clear, actionable requirements. Use tables/lists over prose. User skill level ({user_skill_level}) affects conversation style ONLY, not document content.</critical>

</step>

<step n="2" goal="Goals and Background Context">

**Goals** - What success looks like for this project

<check if="product brief exists">
  <action>Review goals from product brief and refine for PRD context</action>
</check>

<check if="no product brief">
  <action>Gather goals through discussion with user, use probing questions and converse until you are ready to propose that you have enough information to proceed</action>
</check>

Create a bullet list of single-line desired outcomes that capture user and project goals.

**Scale guidance:**

- Level 2: 2-3 core goals
- Level 3: 3-5 strategic goals
- Level 4: 5-7 comprehensive goals

<template-output>goals</template-output>

**Background Context** - Why this matters now

<check if="product brief exists">
  <action>Summarize key context from brief without redundancy</action>
</check>

<check if="no product brief">
  <action>Gather context through discussion</action>
</check>

Write 1-2 paragraphs covering:

- What problem this solves and why
- Current landscape or need
- Key insights from discovery/brief (if available)

<template-output>background_context</template-output>

</step>

<step n="3" goal="Requirements - Functional and Non-Functional">

**Functional Requirements** - What the system must do

Draft functional requirements as numbered items with FR prefix.

**Scale guidance:**

- Level 2: 8-15 FRs (focused MVP set)
- Level 3: 12-25 FRs (comprehensive product)
- Level 4: 20-35 FRs (enterprise platform)

**Format:**

- FR001: [Clear capability statement]
- FR002: [Another capability]

**Focus on:**

- User-facing capabilities
- Core system behaviors
- Integration requirements
- Data management needs

Group related requirements logically.

<template-output>functional_requirements</template-output>

**Non-Functional Requirements** - How the system must perform

Draft non-functional requirements with NFR prefix.

**Scale guidance:**

- Level 2: 1-3 NFRs (critical MVP only)
- Level 3: 2-5 NFRs (production quality)
- Level 4: 3-7+ NFRs (enterprise grade)

<template-output>non_functional_requirements</template-output>

</step>

<step n="4" goal="User Journeys - scale-adaptive" optional="level == 2">

**Journey Guidelines (scale-adaptive):**

- **Level 2:** 1 simple journey (primary use case happy path)
- **Level 3:** 2-3 detailed journeys (complete flows with decision points)
- **Level 4:** 3-5 comprehensive journeys (all personas and edge cases)

<check if="level == 2">
  <ask>Would you like to document a user journey for the primary use case? (recommended but optional)</ask>
  <check if="yes">
    Create 1 simple journey showing the happy path.

</step>

<step n="5" goal="UX and UI Vision - high-level overview" optional="level == 2 and minimal UI">

**Purpose:** Capture essential UX/UI information needed for epic and story planning. A dedicated UX workflow will provide deeper design detail later.

<check if="level == 2 and minimal UI">
  <action>For backend-heavy or minimal UI projects, keep this section very brief or skip</action>
</check>

**Gather high-level UX/UI information:**

1. **UX Principles** (2-4 key principles that guide design decisions)
   - What core experience qualities matter most?
   - Any critical accessibility or usability requirements?

2. **Platform & Screens**
   - Target platforms (web, mobile, desktop)
   - Core screens/views users will interact with
   - Key interaction patterns or navigation approach

3. **Design Constraints**
   - Existing design systems or brand guidelines
   - Technical UI constraints (browser support, etc.)

<note>Keep responses high-level. Detailed UX planning happens in the UX workflow after PRD completion.</note>

</step>

<step n="6" goal="Epic List - High-level delivery sequence">

**Epic Structure** - Major delivery milestones

Create high-level epic list showing logical delivery sequence.

**Epic Sequencing Rules:**

1. **Epic 1 MUST establish foundation**
   - Project infrastructure (repo, CI/CD, core setup)
   - Initial deployable functionality
   - Development workflow established
   - Exception: If adding to existing app, Epic 1 can be first major feature

2. **Subsequent Epics:**
   - Each delivers significant, end-to-end, fully deployable increment
   - Build upon previous epics (no forward dependencies)
   - Represent major functional blocks
   - Prefer fewer, larger epics over fragmentation

**Scale guidance:**

- Level 2: 1-2 epics, 5-15 stories total
- Level 3: 2-5 epics, 15-40 stories total
- Level 4: 5-10 epics, 40-100+ stories total

**For each epic provide:**

- Epic number and title
- Single-sentence goal statement
- Estimated story count

**Example:**

- **Epic 1: Project Foundation & User Authentication**
- **Epic 2: Core Task Management**

<ask>Review the epic list. Does the sequence make sense? Any epics to add, remove, or resequence?</ask>
<action>Refine epic list based on feedback</action>

<template-output>epic_list</template-output>

</step>

<step n="7" goal="Out of Scope - Clear boundaries and future additions">

**Out of Scope** - What we're NOT doing (now)

Document what is explicitly excluded from this project:

- Features/capabilities deferred to future phases
- Adjacent problems not being solved
- Integrations or platforms not supported
- Scope boundaries that need clarification

This helps prevent scope creep and sets clear expectations.

<template-output>out_of_scope</template-output>

</step>

<step n="8" goal="Finalize PRD.md">

<action>Review all PRD sections for completeness and consistency</action>
<action>Ensure all placeholders are filled</action>
<action>Save final PRD.md to {default_output_file}</action>

**PRD.md is complete!** Strategic document ready.

Now we'll create the tactical implementation guide in epics.md.

</step>

<step n="9" goal="Epic Details - Full story breakdown in epics.md">

<critical>Now we create epics.md - the tactical implementation roadmap</critical>
<critical>This is a SEPARATE FILE from PRD.md</critical>

<action>Load epics template: {epics_template}</action>
<action>Initialize epics.md with project metadata</action>

For each epic from the epic list, expand with full story details:

**Epic Expansion Process:**

1. **Expanded Goal** (2-3 sentences)
   - Describe the epic's objective and value delivery
   - Explain how it builds on previous work

2. **Story Breakdown**

   **Critical Story Requirements:**
   - **Vertical slices** - Each story delivers complete, testable functionality
   - **Sequential** - Stories must be logically ordered within epic
   - **No forward dependencies** - No story depends on work from a later story/epic
   - **AI-agent sized** - Completable in single focused session (2-4 hours)
   - **Value-focused** - Minimize pure enabler stories; integrate technical work into value delivery

   **Story Format:**

   ```
   **Story [EPIC.N]: [Story Title]**

   As a [user type],
   I want [goal/desire],
   So that [benefit/value].

   **Acceptance Criteria:**
   1. [Specific testable criterion]
   2. [Another specific criterion]
   3. [etc.]

   **Prerequisites:** [Any dependencies on previous stories]
   ```

3. **Story Sequencing Within Epic:**
   - Start with foundational/setup work if needed
   - Build progressively toward epic goal
   - Each story should leave system in working state
   - Final stories complete the epic's value delivery

**Process each epic:**

<repeat for-each="epic in epic_list">

<ask>Ready to break down {{epic_title}}? (y/n)</ask>

<action>Discuss epic scope and story ideas with user</action>
<action>Draft story list ensuring vertical slices and proper sequencing</action>
<action>For each story, write user story format and acceptance criteria</action>
<action>Verify no forward dependencies exist</action>

<template-output file="epics.md">{{epic_title}}\_details</template-output>

<ask>Review {{epic_title}} stories. Any adjustments needed?</ask>

<action if="yes">Refine stories based on feedback</action>

</repeat>

<action>Save complete epics.md to {epics_output_file}</action>

**Epic Details complete!** Implementation roadmap ready.

</step>

<step n="10" goal="Update status and complete" tag="workflow-status">

<check if="standalone_mode != true">
  <action>Load the FULL file: {output_folder}/bmm-workflow-status.yaml</action>
  <action>Find workflow_status key "prd"</action>
  <critical>ONLY write the file path as the status value - no other text, notes, or metadata</critical>
  <action>Update workflow_status["prd"] = "{default_output_file}"</action>
  <action>Save file, preserving ALL comments and structure including STATUS DEFINITIONS</action>

<action>Find first non-completed workflow in workflow_status (next workflow to do)</action>
<action>Determine next agent from path file based on next workflow</action>
</check>

<output>**✅ PRD Workflow Complete, {user_name}!**

**Deliverables Created:**

1. ✅ bmm-PRD.md - Strategic product requirements document
2. ✅ bmm-epics.md - Tactical implementation roadmap with story breakdown

**Next Steps:**

- **Next required:** {{next_workflow}} ({{next_agent}} agent)
- **Optional:** Review PRD and epics with stakeholders, or run `create-design` if you have UI requirements

Check status anytime with: `workflow-status`

Would you like to:

1. Review/refine any section
2. Proceed to next phase
3. Exit and review documents
