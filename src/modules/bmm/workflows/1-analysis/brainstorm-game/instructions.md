    <output>**âœ… Game Brainstorming Session Complete, {user_name}!**

**Session Results:**

- Game brainstorming results saved to: {output_folder}/bmm-brainstorming-session-{{date}}.md

{{#if standalone_mode != true}}
**Status Updated:**

- Progress tracking updated

**Next Steps:**

- **Next required:** {{next_workflow}} ({{next_agent}} agent)
- **Optional:** You can run other analysis workflows (research, game-brief) before proceeding

Check status anytime with: `workflow-status`
{{else}}
**Next Steps:**
Since no workflow is in progress:

- Refer to the BMM workflow guide if unsure what to do next
- Or run `workflow-init` to create a workflow path and get guided next steps
