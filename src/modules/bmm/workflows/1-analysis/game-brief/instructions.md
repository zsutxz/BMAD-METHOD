# Game Brief - Interactive Workflow Instructions

<critical>The workflow execution engine is governed by: {project-root}/bmad/core/tasks/workflow.xml</critical>
<critical>You MUST have already loaded and processed: {installed_path}/workflow.yaml</critical>
<critical>Communicate all responses in {communication_language} and language MUST be tailored to {user_skill_level}</critical>
<critical>Generate all documents in {document_output_language}</critical>

<critical>DOCUMENT OUTPUT: Concise, professional, game-design focused. Use tables/lists over prose. User skill level ({user_skill_level}) affects conversation style ONLY, not document content.</critical>

<step n="2" goal="Choose collaboration mode">
<ask>How would you like to work through the brief?

**1. Interactive Mode** - We'll work through each section together, discussing and refining as we go
**2. YOLO Mode** - I'll generate a complete draft based on our conversation so far, then we'll refine it together

Which approach works best for you?</ask>
