# Develop Story - Workflow Instructions

```xml
<critical>The workflow execution engine is governed by: {project-root}/bmad/core/tasks/workflow.xml</critical>
<critical>You MUST have already loaded and processed: {installed_path}/workflow.yaml</critical>
<critical>Communicate all responses in {communication_language} and language MUST be tailored to {user_skill_level}</critical>
<critical>Generate all documents in {document_output_language}</critical>
<critical>Only modify the story file in these areas: Tasks/Subtasks checkboxes, Dev Agent Record (Debug Log, Completion Notes), File List, Change Log, and Status</critical>
<critical>Execute ALL steps in exact order; do NOT skip steps</critical>
<critical>Absolutely DO NOT stop because of "milestones", "significant progress", or "session boundaries". Continue in a single execution until the story is COMPLETE (all ACs satisfied and all tasks/subtasks checked) UNLESS a HALT condition is triggered or the USER gives other instruction.</critical>
<critical>Do NOT schedule a "next session" or request review pauses unless a HALT condition applies. Only Step 6 decides completion.</critical>

<critical>User skill level ({user_skill_level}) affects conversation style ONLY, not code updates.</critical>
