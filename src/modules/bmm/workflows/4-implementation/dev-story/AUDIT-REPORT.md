# Workflow Audit Report

**Workflow:** dev-story
**Audit Date:** 2025-10-25
**Auditor:** Audit Workflow (BMAD v6)
**Workflow Type:** Action Workflow
**Module:** BMM (BMad Method)

---

## Executive Summary

**Overall Status:** GOOD - Minor issues to address

- Critical Issues: 0
- Important Issues: 3
- Cleanup Recommendations: 2

The dev-story workflow is well-structured and follows most BMAD v6 standards. The workflow correctly sets `web_bundle: false` as expected for implementation workflows. However, there are several config variable usage issues and some variables referenced in instructions that are not defined in the YAML.

---

## 1. Standard Config Block Validation

**Status:** PASS ✓

The workflow.yaml contains all required standard config variables:

- ✓ `config_source: "{project-root}/bmad/bmm/config.yaml"` - Correctly defined
- ✓ `output_folder: "{config_source}:output_folder"` - Pulls from config_source
- ✓ `user_name: "{config_source}:user_name"` - Pulls from config_source
- ✓ `communication_language: "{config_source}:communication_language"` - Pulls from config_source
- ✓ `date: system-generated` - Correctly set

All standard config variables are present and properly formatted using {project-root} variable syntax.

---

## 2. YAML/Instruction/Template Alignment

**Variables Analyzed:** 9 (excluding standard config)
**Used in Instructions:** 6
**Unused (Bloat):** 3

### YAML Variables Defined

1. `story_dir` - USED in instructions (file paths)
2. `context_path` - UNUSED (appears to duplicate story_dir)
3. `story_file` - USED in instructions
4. `context_file` - USED in instructions
5. `installed_path` - USED in instructions (workflow.xml reference)
6. `instructions` - USED in instructions (self-reference in critical tag)
7. `validation` - USED in instructions (checklist reference)
8. `web_bundle` - CONFIGURATION (correctly set to false)
9. `date` - USED in instructions (config variable)

### Variables Used in Instructions But NOT Defined in YAML

**IMPORTANT ISSUE:** The following variables are referenced in instructions.md but are NOT defined in workflow.yaml:

1. `{user_skill_level}` - Used 4 times (lines 6, 13, 173, 182)
2. `{document_output_language}` - Used 1 time (line 7)
3. `{run_until_complete}` - Used 1 time (line 108)
4. `{run_tests_command}` - Used 1 time (line 120)

These variables appear to be pulling from config.yaml but are not explicitly defined in the workflow.yaml file. While the config_source mechanism may provide these, workflow.yaml should document all variables used in the workflow for clarity.

### Unused Variables (Bloat)

1. **context_path** - Defined as `"{config_source}:dev_story_location"` but never used. This duplicates `story_dir` functionality.

---

## 3. Config Variable Usage

**Communication Language:** PASS ✓
**User Name:** PASS ✓
**Output Folder:** PASS ✓
**Date:** PASS ✓

### Detailed Analysis

**Communication Language:**

- ✓ Used in line 6: "Communicate all responses in {communication_language}"
- ✓ Properly used as agent instruction variable (not in template)

**User Name:**

- ✓ Used in line 169: "Communicate to {user_name} that story implementation is complete"
- ✓ Appropriately used for personalization

**Output Folder:**

- ✓ Used multiple times for sprint-status.yaml file paths
- ✓ All file operations target {output_folder} correctly
- ✓ No hardcoded paths detected

**Date:**

- ✓ Available for agent use (system-generated)
- ✓ Used appropriately in context of workflow execution

### Additional Config Variables

**IMPORTANT ISSUE:** The workflow uses additional variables that appear to come from config but are not explicitly documented:

1. `{user_skill_level}` - Used to tailor communication style
2. `{document_output_language}` - Used for document generation
3. `{run_until_complete}` - Used for execution control
4. `{run_tests_command}` - Used for test execution

These should either be:

- Added to workflow.yaml with proper config_source references, OR
- Documented as optional config variables with defaults

---

## 4. Web Bundle Validation

**Web Bundle Present:** No (Intentional)
**Status:** EXPECTED ✓

The workflow correctly sets `web_bundle: false`. This is the expected configuration for implementation workflows that:

- Run locally in the development environment
- Don't need to be bundled for web deployment
- Are IDE-integrated workflows

**No issues found** - This is the correct configuration for dev-story.

---

## 5. Bloat Detection

**Bloat Percentage:** 11% (1 unused field / 9 total fields)
**Cleanup Potential:** Low

### Unused YAML Fields

1. **context_path** (line 11 in workflow.yaml)
   - Defined as: `"{config_source}:dev_story_location"`
   - Never referenced in instructions.md
   - Duplicates functionality of `story_dir` variable
   - **Recommendation:** Remove this variable as `story_dir` serves the same purpose

### Hardcoded Values

No significant hardcoded values that should be variables were detected. The workflow properly uses variables for:

- File paths ({output_folder}, {story_dir})
- User personalization ({user_name})
- Communication style ({communication_language}, {user_skill_level})

### Calculation

- Total yaml fields: 9 (excluding standard config and metadata)
- Used fields: 8
- Unused fields: 1 (context_path)
- Bloat percentage: 11%

**Status:** Acceptable (under 15% threshold)

---

## 6. Template Variable Mapping

**Not Applicable** - This is an action workflow, not a document workflow.

No template.md file exists, which is correct for action-type workflows.

---

## 7. Instructions Quality Analysis

### Structure

- ✓ Steps numbered sequentially (1, 1.5, 2-7)
- ✓ Each step has clear goal attributes
- ✓ Proper use of XML tags (<action>, <check>, <goto>, <anchor>, <output>)
- ✓ Logical flow control with anchors and conditional checks
- ✓ Repeat patterns used appropriately (step 2-5 loop)

### Critical Tags

- ✓ Critical blocks present and well-defined
- ✓ Clear references to workflow execution engine
- ✓ Workflow.yaml load requirement specified
- ✓ Communication preferences documented

### Variable Usage Consistency

**ISSUE:** Inconsistent variable syntax found:

1. Lines 4, 5 use `{project_root}` (underscore)
2. Line 166 uses `{project-root}` (hyphen)

**Recommendation:** Standardize to `{project-root}` throughout (hyphen is the standard in BMAD v6)

### Step Quality

**Excellent:**

- Steps are focused and single-purpose
- Clear HALT conditions defined
- Comprehensive validation checks
- Good error handling patterns
- Iterative execution model well-structured

**Areas for improvement:**

- Step 1 is complex and could potentially be split
- Some <action if="..."> conditionals could be clearer with <check> blocks

---

## Recommendations

### Critical (Fix Immediately)

None - No critical issues detected.

### Important (Address Soon)

1. **Document or Define Missing Variables**
   - Add explicit definitions in workflow.yaml for: `user_skill_level`, `document_output_language`, `run_until_complete`, `run_tests_command`
   - OR document these as optional config variables with defaults
   - These variables are used in instructions but not defined in YAML
   - **Impact:** Reduces clarity and may cause confusion about variable sources

2. **Standardize project-root Variable Syntax**
   - Change line 4 `{project_root}` to `{project-root}` (hyphen)
   - Ensure consistency with BMAD v6 standard naming convention
   - **Impact:** Maintains consistency with framework standards

3. **Remove or Use context_path Variable**
   - Variable `context_path` is defined but never used
   - Since `story_dir` serves the same purpose, remove `context_path`
   - OR if there's a semantic difference, document why both exist
   - **Impact:** Reduces bloat and potential confusion

### Cleanup (Nice to Have)

1. **Consider Splitting Step 1**
   - Step 1 handles both story discovery AND file loading
   - Could be split into "1. Find Story" and "2. Load Story Files"
   - Would improve clarity and maintainability
   - **Impact:** Minor improvement to workflow structure

2. **Add Variable Documentation Comment**
   - Add a comment block in workflow.yaml listing all variables used by this workflow
   - Include both explicit YAML variables and config-pulled variables
   - Example format:
     ```yaml
     # Workflow-specific variables
     # - story_file: Path to story markdown
     # - story_dir: Directory containing stories
     #
     # Config-pulled variables (from bmm/config.yaml)
     # - user_skill_level: User's technical skill level
     # - document_output_language: Language for generated docs
     ```
   - **Impact:** Improves developer understanding and maintenance
