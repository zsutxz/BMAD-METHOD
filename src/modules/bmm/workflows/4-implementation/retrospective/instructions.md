<step n="1" goal="Epic Context Discovery and verify completion" tag="sprint-status">
<action>Help the user identify which epic was just completed through natural conversation</action>
<action>Attempt to auto-detect by checking {output_folder}/stories/ for the highest numbered completed story and extracting the epic number</action>
<action>If auto-detection succeeds, confirm with user: "It looks like Epic {{epic_number}} was just completed - is that correct?"</action>
<action>If auto-detection fails or user indicates different epic, ask them to share which epic they just completed</action>

<action>Verify epic completion status:</action>

<action>Load the FULL file: {output_folder}/sprint-status.yaml</action>
<action>Read ALL development_status entries</action>

<action>Find all stories for epic {{epic_number}}:

- Look for keys starting with "{{epic_number}}-" (e.g., "1-1-", "1-2-", etc.)
- Exclude epic key itself ("epic-{{epic_number}}")
- Exclude retrospective key ("epic-{{epic_number}}-retrospective")
  </action>

<action>Count total stories found for this epic</action>
<action>Count stories with status = "done"</action>
<action>Collect list of pending story keys (status != "done")</action>
<action>Determine if complete: true if all stories are done, false otherwise</action>

<check if="epic is not complete">
  <output>⚠️ Epic {{epic_number}} is not yet complete for retrospective

</action>

<action>Load agent configurations from {agent-manifest}</action>
<action>Ensure key roles present from the {agent_manifest}: Product Owner, Scrum Master (facilitating the retro), Devs, Testing or QA, Architect, Analyst</action>
</step>

<step n="4" goal="Epic Review Discussion">
<action>Scrum Master facilitates Part 1: Reviewing the completed epic through natural, psychologically safe discussion</action>
<action>Create space for each agent to share their perspective in their unique voice and communication style, grounded in actual story data and outcomes</action>
<action>Maintain psychological safety throughout - focus on learning and systems, not blame or individual performance</action>

<action>Guide the retrospective conversation to naturally surface key themes across three dimensions:</action>

**1. Successes and Strengths:**
<action>Facilitate discussion that helps agents share what worked well during the epic - encourage specific examples from completed stories, effective practices, velocity achievements, collaboration wins, and smart technical decisions</action>
<action>Draw out concrete examples: "Can you share a specific story where that approach worked well?"</action>

**2. Challenges and Growth Areas:**
<action>Create safe space for agents to explore challenges encountered - guide them to discuss blockers, process friction, technical debt decisions, and coordination issues with curiosity rather than judgment</action>
<action>Probe for root causes: "What made that challenging? What pattern do we see here?"</action>
<action>Keep focus on systems and processes, not individuals</action>

**3. Insights and Learning:**
<action>Help the team articulate what they learned from this epic - facilitate discovery of patterns to repeat or avoid, skills gained, and process improvements worth trying</action>
<action>Connect insights to future application: "How might this insight help us in future epics?"</action>

<action>For each agent participating (loaded from {agent_manifest}):</action>

- Let them speak naturally in their role's voice and communication style
- Encourage grounding in specific story records, metrics, and real outcomes
- Allow themes to emerge organically rather than forcing a rigid structure
- Follow interesting threads with adaptive questions
- Balance celebration with honest assessment

<action>As facilitator, actively synthesize common themes and patterns as the discussion unfolds</action>
<action>Notice when multiple agents mention similar issues or successes - call these out to deepen the team's shared understanding</action>
<action>Ensure every voice is heard, inviting quieter agents to contribute</action>
</step>

<step n="5" goal="Next Epic Preparation Discussion">
<action>Scrum Master facilitates Part 2: Preparing for the next epic through forward-looking exploration</action>
<action>Shift the team's focus from reflection to readiness - guide each agent to explore preparation needs from their domain perspective</action>

<action>Facilitate discovery across critical preparation dimensions:</action>

**Dependencies and Continuity:**
<action>Guide agents to explore connections between the completed epic and the upcoming one - help them identify what components, decisions, or work from Epic {{completed_number}} the next epic relies upon</action>
<action>Probe for gaps: "What needs to be in place before we can start Epic {{next_number}}?"</action>
<action>Surface hidden dependencies: "Are there integration points we need to verify?"</action>

**Readiness and Setup:**
<action>Facilitate discussion about what preparation work is needed before the next epic can begin successfully - technical setup, knowledge development, refactoring, documentation, or infrastructure</action>
<action>Draw out specific needs: "What do you need to feel ready to start Epic {{next_number}}?"</action>
<action>Identify knowledge gaps: "What do we need to learn or research before diving in?"</action>

**Risks and Mitigation:**
<action>Create space for agents to voice concerns and uncertainties about the upcoming epic based on what they learned from this one</action>
<action>Explore proactively: "Based on Epic {{completed_number}}, what concerns do you have about Epic {{next_number}}?"</action>
<action>Develop mitigation thinking: "What could we do now to reduce that risk?"</action>
<action>Identify early warning signs: "How will we know if we're heading for that problem again?"</action>

<action>For each agent participating:</action>

- Let them share preparation needs in their natural voice
- Encourage domain-specific insights (Architect on technical setup, PM on requirements clarity, etc.)
- Follow interesting preparation threads with adaptive questions
- Help agents build on each other's observations
- Surface quick wins that could de-risk the epic early

<action>As facilitator, identify dependencies between preparation tasks as they emerge</action>
<action>Notice when preparation items from different agents connect or conflict - explore these intersections</action>
<action>Build a shared understanding of what "ready to start Epic {{next_number}}" actually means</action>
</step>

<step n="6" goal="Synthesize Action Items">
<action>Scrum Master identifies patterns across all agent feedback</action>
<action>Synthesizes common themes into team agreements</action>
<action>Creates specific, achievable action items with clear ownership</action>
<action>Develops preparation sprint tasks if significant setup needed</action>

<action>If concerns arise, probe deeper: "What's causing those concerns? What would it take to address them?"</action>
<action if="stability concerns exist">Document concerns and add to Preparation Sprint: Address stability issues before Epic {{next_number}}</action>

**Unresolved Blockers:**
<action>Help user surface any lingering issues that could create problems for the next epic</action>
<action>Ask: "Are there any unresolved blockers or technical issues from Epic {{completed_number}} that we need to address before moving forward?"</action>
<action>Explore impact: "How would these blockers affect Epic {{next_number}} if left unresolved?"</action>
<action if="blockers exist">Document blockers and add to Critical Path with appropriate priority</action>

<action>Synthesize the readiness discussion into a clear picture of what must happen before Epic {{next_number}} can safely begin</action>
<action>Summarize any critical items identified and ensure user agrees with the assessment</action>
