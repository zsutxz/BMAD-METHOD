# Story Approved Workflow Instructions (DEV Agent)

<critical>The workflow execution engine is governed by: {project_root}/bmad/core/tasks/workflow.xml</critical>
<critical>You MUST have already loaded and processed: {installed_path}/workflow.yaml</critical>
<critical>Communicate all responses in {communication_language} and language MUST be tailored to {user_skill_level}</critical>
<critical>Generate all documents in {document_output_language}</critical>

<workflow>

<critical>This workflow is run by DEV agent AFTER user confirms a story is approved (Definition of Done is complete)</critical>
<critical>NO SEARCHING - DEV agent reads status file IN PROGRESS section to know which story was being worked on</critical>
<critical>Workflow: Update story file status, move story IN PROGRESS → DONE, move TODO → IN PROGRESS, move BACKLOG → TODO</critical>

<step n="1" goal="Get story queue from status file">

<invoke-workflow path="{project-root}/bmad/bmm/workflows/workflow-status">
  <param>mode: data</param>
  <param>data_request: all</param>
</invoke-workflow>

<check if="status_exists == false OR in_progress_story == ''">
  <output>❌ No status file or no IN PROGRESS story found.

This workflow requires an active status file with an IN PROGRESS story.

Run `workflow-status` to check your project state.</output>
<action>Exit workflow</action>
</check>

<action>Use extracted story queue:</action>

- {{in_progress_story}}: Current story to mark done
- {{todo_story_id}}: Next story (move to IN PROGRESS)
- {{stories_sequence}}: All stories
- {{stories_done}}: Completed stories
- {{status_file_path}}: Status file to update

</step>

<step n="2" goal="Update the current story file status to Done">

<action>Read the story file: {story_dir}/{current_story_file}</action>

<action>Find the "Status:" line (usually at the top)</action>

<action>Update story file:</action>

- Change: `Status: Ready` or `Status: In Review`
- To: `Status: Done`

<action>Add completion notes if Dev Agent Record section exists:</action>

Find "## Dev Agent Record" section and add:

```
### Completion Notes
**Completed:** {{date}}
**Definition of Done:** All acceptance criteria met, code reviewed, tests passing, deployed
```

<action>Save the story file</action>

</step>

<step n="3" goal="Move story IN PROGRESS → DONE, advance the queue">

<action>Open {output_folder}/bmm-workflow-status.md</action>

<action>Update "#### DONE (Completed Stories)" section:</action>

Add the completed story to the table:

| Story ID             | File                   | Completed Date | Points                   |
| -------------------- | ---------------------- | -------------- | ------------------------ |
| {{current_story_id}} | {{current_story_file}} | {{date}}       | {{current_story_points}} |

... (existing done stories)

**Total completed:** {{done_count + 1}} stories
**Total points completed:** {{done_points + current_story_points}} points

<action>Update "#### IN PROGRESS (Approved for Development)" section:</action>

<check if="todo_story exists">
  Move the TODO story to IN PROGRESS:

#### IN PROGRESS (Approved for Development)

- **Story ID:** {{todo_story_id}}
- **Story Title:** {{todo_story_title}}
- **Story File:** `{{todo_story_file}}`
- **Story Status:** Ready (OR Draft if not yet reviewed)
- **Context File:** `{{context_file_path}}` (if exists, otherwise note "Context not yet generated")
- **Action:** DEV should run `dev-story` workflow to implement this story
  </check>

<check if="todo_story does NOT exist">
  Mark IN PROGRESS as empty:

#### IN PROGRESS (Approved for Development)

(No story currently in progress - all stories complete!)
</check>

<action>Update "#### TODO (Needs Drafting)" section:</action>

<check if="next_backlog_story exists">
  Move the first BACKLOG story to TODO:

#### TODO (Needs Drafting)

- **Story ID:** {{next_backlog_story_id}}
- **Story Title:** {{next_backlog_story_title}}
- **Story File:** `{{next_backlog_story_file}}`
- **Status:** Not created OR Draft (needs review)
- **Action:** SM should run `create-story` workflow to draft this story
  </check>

<check if="next_backlog_story does NOT exist">
  Mark TODO as empty:

#### TODO (Needs Drafting)

(No more stories to draft - all stories are drafted or complete)
</check>

<action>Update "#### BACKLOG (Not Yet Drafted)" section:</action>

Remove the first story from the BACKLOG table (the one we just moved to TODO).

If BACKLOG had 1 story and is now empty:

| Epic                          | Story | ID  | Title | File |
| ----------------------------- | ----- | --- | ----- | ---- |
| (empty - all stories drafted) |       |     |       |      |

**Total in backlog:** 0 stories

<action>Update story counts in "#### Epic/Story Summary" section:</action>

- Increment done_count by 1
- Increment done_points by {{current_story_points}}
- Decrement backlog_count by 1 (if story was moved from BACKLOG → TODO)
- Update epic breakdown:
  - Increment epic_done_stories for the current story's epic

<check if="all stories complete">
  <action>Check "4-Implementation" checkbox in "### Phase Completion Status"</action>
  <action>Set progress_percentage = 100%</action>
</check>

</step>

<step n="4" goal="Update Decision Log, Progress, and Next Action">

<action>Add to "## Decision Log" section:</action>
