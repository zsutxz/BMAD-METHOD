# Senior Developer Review - Workflow Instructions

````xml
<critical>The workflow execution engine is governed by: {project-root}/bmad/core/tasks/workflow.xml</critical>
<critical>You MUST have already loaded and processed: {installed_path}/workflow.yaml</critical>
<critical>Communicate all responses in {communication_language} and language MUST be tailored to {user_skill_level}</critical>
<critical>Generate all documents in {document_output_language}</critical>
<critical>This workflow performs a SYSTEMATIC Senior Developer Review on a story with status "review", validates EVERY acceptance criterion and EVERY completed task, appends structured review notes with evidence, and updates the story status based on outcome.</critical>
<critical>If story_path is provided, use it. Otherwise, find the first story in sprint-status.yaml with status "review". If none found, offer ad-hoc review option.</critical>
<critical>Ad-hoc review mode: User can specify any files to review and what to review for (quality, security, requirements, etc.). Creates standalone review report.</critical>
<critical>SYSTEMATIC VALIDATION REQUIREMENT: For EVERY acceptance criterion, verify implementation with evidence (file:line). For EVERY task marked complete, verify it was actually done. Tasks marked complete but not done = HIGH SEVERITY finding.</critical>
<critical>‚ö†Ô∏è ZERO TOLERANCE FOR LAZY VALIDATION ‚ö†Ô∏è</critical>
<critical>If you FAIL to catch even ONE task marked complete that was NOT actually implemented, or ONE acceptance criterion marked done that is NOT in the code with evidence, you have FAILED YOUR ONLY PURPOSE. This is an IMMEDIATE DISQUALIFICATION. No shortcuts. No assumptions. No "looks good enough." You WILL read every file. You WILL verify every claim. You WILL provide evidence (file:line) for EVERY validation. Failure to catch false completions = you failed humanity and the project. Your job is to be the uncompromising gatekeeper. DO YOUR JOB COMPLETELY OR YOU WILL BE REPLACED.</critical>
<critical>Only modify the story file in these areas: Status, Dev Agent Record (Completion Notes), File List (if corrections needed), Change Log, and the appended "Senior Developer Review (AI)" section.</critical>
<critical>Execute ALL steps in exact order; do NOT skip steps</critical>

<critical>DOCUMENT OUTPUT: Technical review reports. Structured findings with severity levels and action items. User skill level ({user_skill_level}) affects conversation style ONLY, not review content.</critical>

         - HIGH severity issues first (especially falsely marked complete tasks)
         - MEDIUM severity issues
         - LOW severity issues
      4. **Acceptance Criteria Coverage**:
         - Include complete AC validation checklist from Step 4A
         - Show: AC# | Description | Status (IMPLEMENTED/PARTIAL/MISSING) | Evidence (file:line)
         - Summary: "X of Y acceptance criteria fully implemented"
         - List any missing or partial ACs with severity
      5. **Task Completion Validation**:
         - Include complete task validation checklist from Step 4B
         - Show: Task | Marked As | Verified As | Evidence (file:line)
         - **CRITICAL**: Highlight any tasks marked complete but not done in RED/bold
         - Summary: "X of Y completed tasks verified, Z questionable, W falsely marked complete"
      6. **Test Coverage and Gaps**:
         - Which ACs have tests, which don't
         - Test quality issues found
      7. **Architectural Alignment**:
         - Tech-spec compliance
         - Architecture violations if any
      8. **Security Notes**: Security findings if any
      9. **Best-Practices and References**: With links
      10. **Action Items**:
          - CRITICAL: ALL action items requiring code changes MUST have checkboxes for tracking
          - Format for actionable items: `- [ ] [Severity] Description (AC #X) [file: path:line]`
          - Format for informational notes: `- Note: Description (no action required)`
          - Imperative phrasing for action items
          - Map to related ACs or files with specific line references
          - Include suggested owners if clear
          - Example format:
            ```
            ### Action Items

            **Code Changes Required:**
            - [ ] [High] Add input validation on login endpoint (AC #1) [file: src/routes/auth.js:23-45]

            **Advisory Notes:**
            - Note: Consider adding rate limiting for production deployment
            - Note: Document the JWT expiration policy in README
