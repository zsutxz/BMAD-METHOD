    <action>Find the previous completed story to extract dev agent learnings and review findings:
      1. Load {{output_folder}}/sprint-status.yaml COMPLETELY
      2. Find current {{story_key}} in development_status section
      3. Identify the story entry IMMEDIATELY ABOVE current story (previous row in file order)
      4. If previous story exists:
         - Extract {{previous_story_key}}
         - Check previous story status (done, in-progress, review, etc.)
         - If status is "done", "review", or "in-progress" (has some completion):
           * Construct path: {{story_dir}}/{{previous_story_key}}.md

             D) Dev Notes:
                - Any "future story" notes or TODOs
                - Patterns established

        - **New Service Created**: `AuthService` base class available at `src/services/AuthService.js` - use `AuthService.register()` method
        - **Architectural Change**: Switched from session-based to JWT authentication
        - **Schema Changes**: User model now includes `passwordHash` field, migration applied
        - **Technical Debt**: Email verification skipped, should be included in this or subsequent story
        - **Testing Setup**: Auth test suite initialized at `tests/integration/auth.test.js` - follow patterns established there
        - **Pending Review Items**: Rate limiting mentioned in review - consider for this story

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important:** The following workflows are context-intensive. It's recommended to clear context and restart the SM agent before running the next command.

**Next Steps:**
1. Review the drafted story in {{story_file}}
2. **[RECOMMENDED]** Run `story-context` to generate technical context XML and mark story ready for development (combines context + ready in one step)
3. Or run `story-ready` to manually mark the story ready without generating technical context
