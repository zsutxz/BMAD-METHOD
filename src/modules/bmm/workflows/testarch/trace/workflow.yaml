# Variables and inputs
variables:

  # Workflow behavior
  coverage_levels: "e2e,api,component,unit" # Which test levels to trace
  gate_type: "story" # story | epic | release | hotfix - determines gate scope

# Required tools
required_tools:
  - read_file # Read story, test files, BMad artifacts
  - write_file # Create traceability matrix, gate YAML
  - list_files # Discover test files
  - search_repo # Find tests by test ID, describe blocks
  - glob # Find test files matching patterns

# Recommended inputs
