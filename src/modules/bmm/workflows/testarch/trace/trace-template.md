### Detailed Mapping

#### {CRITERION_ID}: {CRITERION_DESCRIPTION} ({PRIORITY})

- **Coverage:** {COVERAGE_STATUS} {STATUS_ICON}
- **Tests:**
  - `{TEST_ID}` - {TEST_FILE}:{LINE}
    - **Given:** {GIVEN}
    - **When:** {WHEN}
    - **Then:** {THEN}
  - `{TEST_ID_2}` - {TEST_FILE_2}:{LINE}
    - **Given:** {GIVEN_2}
    - **When:** {WHEN_2}
    - **Then:** {THEN_2}

- **Gaps:** (if PARTIAL or UNIT-ONLY or INTEGRATION-ONLY)
  - Missing: {MISSING_SCENARIO_1}
  - Missing: {MISSING_SCENARIO_2}

- **Recommendation:** {RECOMMENDATION_TEXT}

---

#### Example: AC-1: User can login with email and password (P0)

- **Coverage:** FULL ✅
- **Tests:**
  - `1.3-E2E-001` - tests/e2e/auth.spec.ts:12
    - **Given:** User has valid credentials
    - **When:** User submits login form
    - **Then:** User is redirected to dashboard
  - `1.3-UNIT-001` - tests/unit/auth-service.spec.ts:8
    - **Given:** Valid email and password hash
    - **When:** validateCredentials is called
    - **Then:** Returns user object

---

#### Example: AC-3: User can reset password via email (P1)

- **Coverage:** PARTIAL ⚠️
- **Tests:**
  - `1.3-E2E-003` - tests/e2e/auth.spec.ts:44
    - **Given:** User requests password reset
    - **When:** User clicks reset link in email
    - **Then:** User can set new password

- **Gaps:**
  - Missing: Email delivery validation
  - Missing: Expired token handling (error path)
  - Missing: Invalid token handling (security test)
  - Missing: Unit test for token generation logic

- **Recommendation:** Add `1.3-API-001` for email service integration testing and `1.3-UNIT-003` for token generation logic. Add `1.3-E2E-004` for error path validation (expired/invalid tokens).

2. **{ACTION_2}** - {DESCRIPTION}

#### Long-term Actions (Backlog)

1. **{ACTION_1}** - {DESCRIPTION}

---

#### Example Recommendations

**Immediate Actions (Before PR Merge)**

1. **Add P1 Password Reset Tests** - Implement `1.3-API-001` for email service integration and `1.3-E2E-004` for error path validation. P1 coverage currently at 80%, target is 90%.

**Short-term Actions (This Sprint)**

1. **Enhance P2 Coverage** - Add E2E validation for session timeout (`1.3-E2E-005`). Currently UNIT-ONLY coverage.
2. **Split Large Test File** - Break `1.3-UNIT-005` (320 lines) into multiple focused test files (<300 lines each).

**Long-term Actions (Backlog)**

1. **Enrich P3 Coverage** - Add tests for edge cases in P3 criteria if time permits.

---

#### P1 Criteria (Required for PASS, May Accept for CONCERNS)

| Criterion              | Threshold                 | Actual               | Status   |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------- | -------------------- | -------- | ----------- | -------- |

**P1 Evaluation**: {✅ ALL PASS | ⚠️ SOME CONCERNS | ❌ FAILED}

---

#### P2/P3 Criteria (Informational, Don't Block)

| Criterion         | Actual          | Notes                                                        |

---

### GATE DECISION: {PASS | CONCERNS | FAIL | WAIVED}

---

### Rationale

{Explain decision based on criteria evaluation}

{Highlight key evidence that drove decision}

{Note any assumptions or caveats}

**Example (PASS):**

> All P0 criteria met with 100% coverage and pass rates across critical tests. All P1 criteria exceeded thresholds with 98% overall pass rate and 92% coverage. No security issues detected. No flaky tests in validation. Feature is ready for production deployment with standard monitoring.

**Example (CONCERNS):**

> All P0 criteria met, ensuring critical user journeys are protected. However, P1 coverage (88%) falls below threshold (90%) due to missing E2E test for AC-5 edge case. Overall pass rate (96%) is excellent. Issues are non-critical and have acceptable workarounds. Risk is low enough to deploy with enhanced monitoring.

**Example (FAIL):**

> CRITICAL BLOCKERS DETECTED:
>
> 1. P0 coverage incomplete (80%) - AC-2 security validation missing
> 2. P0 test failures (75% pass rate) in core search functionality
> 3. Unresolved SQL injection vulnerability in search filter (CRITICAL)
>
> Release MUST BE BLOCKED until P0 issues are resolved. Security vulnerability cannot be waived.

**Example (WAIVED):**

> Original decision was FAIL due to P0 test failure in legacy Excel 2007 export module (affects <1% of users). However, release contains critical GDPR compliance features required by regulatory deadline (Oct 15). Business has approved waiver given:
>
> - Regulatory priority overrides legacy module risk
> - Workaround available (use Excel 2010+)
> - Issue will be fixed in v2.4.1 hotfix (due Oct 20)
> - Enhanced monitoring in place
