# Test Quality Review - Instructions v4.0

**Workflow:** `testarch-test-review`
**Purpose:** Review test quality using TEA's comprehensive knowledge base and validate against best practices for maintainability, determinism, isolation, and flakiness prevention
**Agent:** Test Architect (TEA)
**Format:** Pure Markdown v4.0 (no XML blocks)

---

## Overview

This workflow performs comprehensive test quality reviews using TEA's knowledge base of best practices. It validates tests against proven patterns for fixture architecture, network-first safeguards, data factories, determinism, isolation, and flakiness prevention. The review generates actionable feedback with quality scoring.

**Key Capabilities:**

- **Knowledge-Based Review**: Applies patterns from tea-index.csv fragments
- **Quality Scoring**: 0-100 score based on violations and best practices
- **Multi-Scope**: Review single file, directory, or entire test suite
- **Pattern Detection**: Identifies flaky patterns, hard waits, race conditions
- **Best Practice Validation**: BDD format, test IDs, priorities, assertions
- **Actionable Feedback**: Critical issues (must fix) vs recommendations (should fix)
- **Integration**: Works with story files, test-design, acceptance criteria

---

## Prerequisites

**Required:**

- Test file(s) to review (auto-discovered or explicitly provided)
- Test framework configuration (playwright.config.ts, jest.config.js, etc.)

**Recommended:**

- Story file with acceptance criteria (for context)
- Test design document (for priority context)
- Knowledge base fragments available in tea-index.csv

**Halt Conditions:**

- If test file path is invalid or file doesn't exist, halt and request correction
- If test_dir is empty (no tests found), halt and notify user

---

## Workflow Steps

### Step 1: Load Context and Knowledge Base

**Actions:**

1. Load relevant knowledge fragments from `{project-root}/bmad/bmm/testarch/tea-index.csv`:
   - `test-quality.md` - Definition of Done (deterministic tests, isolated with cleanup, explicit assertions, <300 lines, <1.5 min, 658 lines, 5 examples)
   - `fixture-architecture.md` - Pure function → Fixture → mergeTests composition with auto-cleanup (406 lines, 5 examples)
   - `network-first.md` - Route intercept before navigate to prevent race conditions (intercept before navigate, HAR capture, deterministic waiting, 489 lines, 5 examples)
   - `data-factories.md` - Factory functions with faker: overrides, nested factories, API-first setup (498 lines, 5 examples)
   - `test-levels-framework.md` - E2E vs API vs Component vs Unit appropriateness with decision matrix (467 lines, 4 examples)
   - `playwright-config.md` - Environment-based configuration with fail-fast validation (722 lines, 5 examples)
   - `component-tdd.md` - Red-Green-Refactor patterns with provider isolation, accessibility, visual regression (480 lines, 4 examples)
   - `selective-testing.md` - Duplicate coverage detection with tag-based, spec filter, diff-based selection (727 lines, 4 examples)
   - `test-healing-patterns.md` - Common failure patterns: stale selectors, race conditions, dynamic data, network errors, hard waits (648 lines, 5 examples)
   - `selector-resilience.md` - Selector best practices (data-testid > ARIA > text > CSS hierarchy, anti-patterns, 541 lines, 4 examples)
   - `timing-debugging.md` - Race condition prevention and async debugging techniques (370 lines, 3 examples)
   - `ci-burn-in.md` - Flaky test detection with 10-iteration burn-in loop (678 lines, 4 examples)

2. Determine review scope:
   - **single**: Review one test file (`test_file_path` provided)
   - **directory**: Review all tests in directory (`test_dir` provided)
   - **suite**: Review entire test suite (discover all test files)

3. Auto-discover related artifacts (if `auto_discover_story: true`):
   - Extract test ID from filename (e.g., `1.3-E2E-001.spec.ts` → story 1.3)
   - Search for story file (`story-1.3.md`)
   - Search for test design (`test-design-story-1.3.md` or `test-design-epic-1.md`)

4. Read story file for context (if available):
   - Extract acceptance criteria
   - Extract priority classification
   - Extract expected test IDs

**Output:** Complete knowledge base loaded, review scope determined, context gathered

---

### Step 2: Discover and Parse Test Files

**Actions:**

1. **Discover test files** based on scope:
   - **single**: Use `test_file_path` variable
   - **directory**: Use `glob` to find all test files in `test_dir` (e.g., `*.spec.ts`, `*.test.js`)
   - **suite**: Use `glob` to find all test files recursively from project root

2. **Parse test file metadata**:
   - File path and name
   - File size (warn if >15 KB or >300 lines)
   - Test framework detected (Playwright, Jest, Cypress, Vitest, etc.)
   - Imports and dependencies
   - Test structure (describe/context/it blocks)

3. **Extract test structure**:
   - Count of describe blocks (test suites)
   - Count of it/test blocks (individual tests)
   - Test IDs (if present, e.g., `test.describe('1.3-E2E-001')`)
   - Priority markers (if present, e.g., `test.describe.only` for P0)
   - BDD structure (Given-When-Then comments or steps)

4. **Identify test patterns**:
   - Fixtures used
   - Data factories used
   - Network interception patterns
   - Assertions used (expect, assert, toHaveText, etc.)
   - Waits and timeouts (page.waitFor, sleep, hardcoded delays)
   - Conditionals (if/else, switch, ternary)
   - Try/catch blocks
   - Shared state or globals

**Output:** Complete test file inventory with structure and pattern analysis

---

### Step 3: Validate Against Quality Criteria

**Actions:**

For each test file, validate against quality criteria (configurable via workflow variables):

#### 1. BDD Format Validation (if `check_given_when_then: true`)

- ✅ **PASS**: Tests use Given-When-Then structure (comments or step organization)
- ⚠️ **WARN**: Tests have some structure but not explicit GWT
- ❌ **FAIL**: Tests lack clear structure, hard to understand intent

**Knowledge Fragment**: test-quality.md, tdd-cycles.md

---

#### 2. Test ID Conventions (if `check_test_ids: true`)

- ✅ **PASS**: Test IDs present and follow convention (e.g., `1.3-E2E-001`, `2.1-API-005`)
- ⚠️ **WARN**: Some test IDs missing or inconsistent
- ❌ **FAIL**: No test IDs, can't trace tests to requirements

**Knowledge Fragment**: traceability.md, test-quality.md

---

#### 3. Priority Markers (if `check_priority_markers: true`)

- ✅ **PASS**: Tests classified as P0/P1/P2/P3 (via markers or test-design reference)
- ⚠️ **WARN**: Some priority classifications missing
- ❌ **FAIL**: No priority classification, can't determine criticality

**Knowledge Fragment**: test-priorities.md, risk-governance.md

---

#### 4. Hard Waits Detection (if `check_hard_waits: true`)

- ✅ **PASS**: No hard waits detected (no `sleep()`, `wait(5000)`, hardcoded delays)
- ⚠️ **WARN**: Some hard waits used but with justification comments
- ❌ **FAIL**: Hard waits detected without justification (flakiness risk)

**Patterns to detect:**

- `sleep(1000)`, `setTimeout()`, `delay()`
- `page.waitForTimeout(5000)` without explicit reason
- `await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 3000))`

**Knowledge Fragment**: test-quality.md, network-first.md

---

#### 5. Determinism Check (if `check_determinism: true`)

- ✅ **PASS**: Tests are deterministic (no conditionals, no try/catch abuse, no random values)
- ⚠️ **WARN**: Some conditionals but with clear justification
- ❌ **FAIL**: Tests use if/else, switch, or try/catch to control flow (flakiness risk)

**Patterns to detect:**

- `if (condition) { test logic }` - tests should work deterministically
- `try { test } catch { fallback }` - tests shouldn't swallow errors
- `Math.random()`, `Date.now()` without factory abstraction

**Knowledge Fragment**: test-quality.md, data-factories.md

---

#### 6. Isolation Validation (if `check_isolation: true`)

- ✅ **PASS**: Tests clean up resources, no shared state, can run in any order
- ⚠️ **WARN**: Some cleanup missing but isolated enough
- ❌ **FAIL**: Tests share state, depend on execution order, leave resources

**Patterns to check:**

- afterEach/afterAll cleanup hooks present
- No global variables mutated
- Database/API state cleaned up after tests
- Test data deleted or marked inactive

**Knowledge Fragment**: test-quality.md, data-factories.md

---

#### 7. Fixture Patterns (if `check_fixture_patterns: true`)

- ✅ **PASS**: Uses pure function → Fixture → mergeTests pattern
- ⚠️ **WARN**: Some fixtures used but not consistently
- ❌ **FAIL**: No fixtures, tests repeat setup code (maintainability risk)

**Patterns to check:**

- Fixtures defined (e.g., `test.extend({ customFixture: async ({}, use) => { ... }})`)
- Pure functions used for fixture logic
- mergeTests used to combine fixtures
- No beforeEach with complex setup (should be in fixtures)

**Knowledge Fragment**: fixture-architecture.md

---

#### 8. Data Factories (if `check_data_factories: true`)

- ✅ **PASS**: Uses factory functions with overrides, API-first setup
- ⚠️ **WARN**: Some factories used but also hardcoded data
- ❌ **FAIL**: Hardcoded test data, magic strings/numbers (maintainability risk)

**Patterns to check:**

- Factory functions defined (e.g., `createUser()`, `generateInvoice()`)
- Factories use faker.js or similar for realistic data
- Factories accept overrides (e.g., `createUser({ email: 'custom@example.com' })`)
- API-first setup (create via API, test via UI)

**Knowledge Fragment**: data-factories.md

---

#### 9. Network-First Pattern (if `check_network_first: true`)

- ✅ **PASS**: Route interception set up BEFORE navigation (race condition prevention)
- ⚠️ **WARN**: Some routes intercepted correctly, others after navigation
- ❌ **FAIL**: Route interception after navigation (race condition risk)

**Patterns to check:**

- `page.route()` called before `page.goto()`
- `page.waitForResponse()` used with explicit URL pattern
- No navigation followed immediately by route setup

**Knowledge Fragment**: network-first.md

---

#### 10. Assertions (if `check_assertions: true`)

- ✅ **PASS**: Explicit assertions present (expect, assert, toHaveText)
- ⚠️ **WARN**: Some tests rely on implicit waits instead of assertions
- ❌ **FAIL**: Missing assertions, tests don't verify behavior

**Patterns to check:**

- Each test has at least one assertion
- Assertions are specific (not just truthy checks)
- Assertions use framework-provided matchers (toHaveText, toBeVisible)

**Knowledge Fragment**: test-quality.md

---

#### 11. Test Length (if `check_test_length: true`)

- ✅ **PASS**: Test file ≤200 lines (ideal), ≤300 lines (acceptable)
- ⚠️ **WARN**: Test file 301-500 lines (consider splitting)
- ❌ **FAIL**: Test file >500 lines (too large, maintainability risk)

**Knowledge Fragment**: test-quality.md

---

#### 12. Test Duration (if `check_test_duration: true`)

- ✅ **PASS**: Individual tests ≤1.5 minutes (target: <30 seconds)
- ⚠️ **WARN**: Some tests 1.5-3 minutes (consider optimization)
- ❌ **FAIL**: Tests >3 minutes (too slow, impacts CI/CD)

**Note:** Duration estimation based on complexity analysis if execution data unavailable

**Knowledge Fragment**: test-quality.md, selective-testing.md

---

#### 13. Flakiness Patterns (if `check_flakiness_patterns: true`)

- ✅ **PASS**: No known flaky patterns detected
- ⚠️ **WARN**: Some potential flaky patterns (e.g., tight timeouts, race conditions)
- ❌ **FAIL**: Multiple flaky patterns detected (high flakiness risk)

**Patterns to detect:**

- Tight timeouts (e.g., `{ timeout: 1000 }`)
- Race conditions (navigation before route interception)
- Timing-dependent assertions (e.g., checking timestamps)
- Retry logic in tests (hides flakiness)
- Environment-dependent assumptions (hardcoded URLs, ports)

**Knowledge Fragment**: test-quality.md, network-first.md, ci-burn-in.md

### Step 4: Calculate Quality Score

**Actions:**

1. **Count violations** by severity:
   - **Critical (P0)**: Hard waits without justification, no assertions, race conditions, shared state
   - **High (P1)**: Missing test IDs, no BDD structure, hardcoded data, missing fixtures
   - **Medium (P2)**: Long test files (>300 lines), missing priorities, some conditionals
   - **Low (P3)**: Minor style issues, incomplete cleanup, verbose tests

2. **Calculate quality score** (if `quality_score_enabled: true`):

```
Starting Score: 100

Critical Violations: -10 points each
High Violations: -5 points each
Medium Violations: -2 points each
Low Violations: -1 point each

Bonus Points:
+ Excellent BDD structure: +5
+ Comprehensive fixtures: +5
+ Comprehensive data factories: +5
+ Network-first pattern: +5
+ Perfect isolation: +5
+ All test IDs present: +5

Quality Score: max(0, min(100, Starting Score - Violations + Bonus))
```

3. **Quality Grade**:
   - **90-100**: Excellent (A+)
   - **80-89**: Good (A)
   - **70-79**: Acceptable (B)
   - **60-69**: Needs Improvement (C)
   - **<60**: Critical Issues (F)

**Output:** Quality score calculated with violation breakdown

---

### Step 5: Generate Review Report

**Actions:**

1. **Create review report** using `test-review-template.md`:

   **Header Section:**
   - Test file(s) reviewed
   - Review date
   - Review scope (single/directory/suite)
   - Quality score and grade

   **Executive Summary:**
   - Overall assessment (Excellent/Good/Needs Improvement/Critical)
   - Key strengths
   - Key weaknesses
   - Recommendation (Approve/Approve with comments/Request changes)

   **Quality Criteria Assessment:**
   - Table with all criteria evaluated
   - Status for each (PASS/WARN/FAIL)
   - Violation count per criterion

   **Critical Issues (Must Fix):**
   - Priority P0/P1 violations
   - Code location (file:line)
   - Explanation of issue
   - Recommended fix
   - Knowledge base reference

   **Recommendations (Should Fix):**
   - Priority P2/P3 violations
   - Code location (file:line)
   - Explanation of issue
   - Recommended improvement
   - Knowledge base reference

   **Best Practices Examples:**
   - Highlight good patterns found in tests
   - Reference knowledge base fragments
   - Provide examples for others to follow

   **Knowledge Base References:**
   - List all fragments consulted
   - Provide links to detailed guidance

2. **Generate inline comments** (if `generate_inline_comments: true`):
   - Add TODO comments in test files at violation locations
   - Format: `// TODO (TEA Review): [Issue description] - See test-review-{filename}.md`
   - Never modify test logic, only add comments

3. **Generate quality badge** (if `generate_quality_badge: true`):
   - Create badge with quality score (e.g., "Test Quality: 87/100 (A)")
   - Format for inclusion in README or documentation

4. **Append to story file** (if `append_to_story: true` and story file exists):
   - Add "Test Quality Review" section to story
   - Include quality score and critical issues
   - Link to full review report

**Output:** Comprehensive review report with actionable feedback

---

### Step 6: Save Outputs and Notify

**Actions:**

1. **Save review report** to `{output_file}`
2. **Save inline comments** to test files (if enabled)
3. **Save quality badge** to output folder (if enabled)
4. **Update story file** (if enabled)
5. **Generate summary message** for user:
   - Quality score and grade
   - Critical issue count
   - Recommendation

**Output:** All review artifacts saved and user notified

## Example Review Summary

````markdown
# Test Quality Review: auth-login.spec.ts

**Quality Score**: 78/100 (B - Acceptable)
**Review Date**: 2025-10-14
**Recommendation**: Approve with Comments

## Executive Summary

Overall, the test demonstrates good structure and coverage of the login flow. However, there are several areas for improvement to enhance maintainability and prevent flakiness.

**Strengths:**

- Excellent BDD structure with clear Given-When-Then comments
- Good use of test IDs (1.3-E2E-001, 1.3-E2E-002)
- Comprehensive assertions on authentication state

**Weaknesses:**

- Hard wait detected (page.waitForTimeout(2000)) - flakiness risk
- Hardcoded test data (email: 'test@example.com') - use factories instead
- Missing fixture for common login setup - DRY violation

**Recommendation**: Address critical issue (hard wait) before merging. Other improvements can be addressed in follow-up PR.

## Critical Issues (Must Fix)

### 1. Hard Wait Detected (Line 45)

**Severity**: P0 (Critical)
**Issue**: `await page.waitForTimeout(2000)` introduces flakiness
**Fix**: Use explicit wait for element or network request instead
**Knowledge**: See test-quality.md, network-first.md

```typescript
// ❌ Bad (current)
await page.waitForTimeout(2000);
await expect(page.locator('[data-testid="user-menu"]')).toBeVisible();

// ✅ Good (recommended)
await expect(page.locator('[data-testid="user-menu"]')).toBeVisible({ timeout: 10000 });
```
````

## Recommendations (Should Fix)

### 1. Use Data Factory for Test User (Lines 23, 32, 41)

**Severity**: P1 (High)
**Issue**: Hardcoded email 'test@example.com' - maintainability risk
**Fix**: Create factory function for test users
**Knowledge**: See data-factories.md

```typescript
// ✅ Good (recommended)
import { createTestUser } from './factories/user-factory';

const testUser = createTestUser({ role: 'admin' });
await loginPage.login(testUser.email, testUser.password);
```

### 2. Extract Login Setup to Fixture (Lines 18-28)

**Severity**: P1 (High)
**Issue**: Login setup repeated across tests - DRY violation
**Fix**: Create fixture for authenticated state
**Knowledge**: See fixture-architecture.md

```typescript
// ✅ Good (recommended)
const test = base.extend({
  authenticatedPage: async ({ page }, use) => {
    const user = createTestUser();
    await loginPage.login(user.email, user.password);
    await use(page);
  },
});

test('user can access dashboard', async ({ authenticatedPage }) => {
  // Test starts already logged in
});
```

## Quality Score Breakdown

- Starting Score: 100
- Critical Violations (1 × -10): -10
- High Violations (2 × -5): -10
- Medium Violations (0 × -2): 0
- Low Violations (1 × -1): -1
- Bonus (BDD +5, Test IDs +5): +10
- **Final Score**: 78/100 (B)

```

## Integration with Other Workflows

### Before Test Review

- **atdd**: Generate acceptance tests (TEA reviews them for quality)
- **automate**: Expand regression suite (TEA reviews new tests)
- **dev story**: Developer writes implementation tests (TEA reviews them)

### After Test Review

- **Developer**: Addresses critical issues, improves based on recommendations
- **gate**: Test quality review feeds into gate decision (high-quality tests increase confidence)

### Coordinates With

- **Story File**: Review links to acceptance criteria context
- **Test Design**: Review validates tests align with prioritization
- **Knowledge Base**: Review references fragments for detailed guidance

---

## Important Notes

1. **Non-Prescriptive**: Review provides guidance, not rigid rules
2. **Context Matters**: Some violations may be justified for specific scenarios
3. **Knowledge-Based**: All feedback grounded in proven patterns from tea-index.csv
4. **Actionable**: Every issue includes recommended fix with code examples
5. **Quality Score**: Use as indicator, not absolute measure
6. **Continuous Improvement**: Review same tests periodically as patterns evolve

---

## Troubleshooting

**Problem: No test files found**
- Verify test_dir path is correct
- Check test file extensions match glob pattern
- Ensure test files exist in expected location

**Problem: Quality score seems too low/high**
- Review violation counts - may need to adjust thresholds
- Consider context - some projects have different standards
- Focus on critical issues first, not just score

**Problem: Inline comments not generated**
- Check generate_inline_comments: true in variables
- Verify write permissions on test files
- Review append_to_file: false (separate report mode)

**Problem: Knowledge fragments not loading**
- Verify tea-index.csv exists in testarch/ directory
- Check fragment file paths are correct
- Ensure auto_load_knowledge: true in variables
```
