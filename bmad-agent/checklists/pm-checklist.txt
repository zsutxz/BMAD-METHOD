### Critical Deficiencies
- List all critical issues that must be addressed before handoff to Architect

### Recommendations
- Provide specific recommendations for addressing each deficiency

### Final Decision
- **READY FOR ARCHITECT**: The PRD and epics are comprehensive, properly structured, and ready for architectural design.
- **NEEDS REFINEMENT**: The requirements documentation requires additional work to address the identified deficiencies.
