# @fileoverview TTS Provider Router with Language Learning Support
# @context Routes TTS requests to active provider (ElevenLabs or Piper)
# @architecture Provider abstraction layer - single entry point for all TTS
# @dependencies provider-manager.sh, play-tts-elevenlabs.sh, play-tts-piper.sh, github-star-reminder.sh
# @entrypoints Called by hooks, slash commands, personality-manager.sh, and all TTS features
# @patterns Provider pattern - delegates to provider-specific implementations, auto-detects provider from voice name
# @related provider-manager.sh, play-tts-elevenlabs.sh, play-tts-piper.sh, learn-manager.sh
