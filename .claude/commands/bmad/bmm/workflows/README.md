**prd**

- Path: `bmad/bmm/workflows/2-plan-workflows/prd/workflow.yaml`
- Unified PRD workflow for project levels 2-4. Produces strategic PRD and tactical epic breakdown. Hands off to architecture workflow for technical design. Note: Level 0-1 use tech-spec workflow.

**tech-spec-sm**

- Path: `bmad/bmm/workflows/2-plan-workflows/tech-spec/workflow.yaml`
- Technical specification workflow for Level 0 projects (single atomic changes). Creates focused tech spec for bug fixes, single endpoint additions, or small isolated changes. Tech-spec only - no PRD needed.

**architecture**

- Path: `bmad/bmm/workflows/3-solutioning/architecture/workflow.yaml`
- Collaborative architectural decision facilitation for AI-agent consistency. Replaces template-driven architecture with intelligent, adaptive conversation that produces a decision-focused architecture document optimized for preventing agent conflicts.

**code-review**

- Path: `bmad/bmm/workflows/4-implementation/code-review/workflow.yaml`

**correct-course**

- Path: `bmad/bmm/workflows/4-implementation/correct-course/workflow.yaml`
- Navigate significant changes during sprint execution by analyzing impact, proposing solutions, and routing for implementation

**create-story**

- Path: `bmad/bmm/workflows/4-implementation/create-story/workflow.yaml`
- Create the next user story markdown from epics/PRD and architecture, using a standard template and saving to the stories folder

**dev-story**

- Path: `bmad/bmm/workflows/4-implementation/dev-story/workflow.yaml`
- Execute a story by implementing tasks/subtasks, writing tests, validating, and updating the story file per acceptance criteria

**epic-tech-context**

- Path: `bmad/bmm/workflows/4-implementation/epic-tech-context/workflow.yaml`
- Generate a comprehensive Technical Specification from PRD and Architecture with acceptance criteria and traceability mapping

**retrospective**

- Path: `bmad/bmm/workflows/4-implementation/retrospective/workflow.yaml`
- Run after epic completion to review overall success, extract lessons learned, and explore if new information emerged that might impact the next epic

**sprint-planning**

- Path: `bmad/bmm/workflows/4-implementation/sprint-planning/workflow.yaml`
- Generate and manage the sprint status tracking file for Phase 4 implementation, extracting all epics and stories from epic files and tracking their status through the development lifecycle

**story-context**

- Path: `bmad/bmm/workflows/4-implementation/story-context/workflow.yaml`
- Assemble a dynamic Story Context XML by pulling latest documentation and existing code/library artifacts relevant to a drafted story

**story-done**

- Path: `bmad/bmm/workflows/4-implementation/story-done/workflow.yaml`
- Marks a story as done (DoD complete) and moves it from its current status → DONE in the status file. Advances the story queue. Simple status-update workflow with no searching required.

**story-ready**

- Path: `bmad/bmm/workflows/4-implementation/story-ready/workflow.yaml`
- Marks a drafted story as ready for development and moves it from TODO → IN PROGRESS in the status file. Simple status-update workflow with no searching required.

**document-project**

- Path: `bmad/bmm/workflows/document-project/workflow.yaml`
- Analyzes and documents brownfield projects by scanning codebase, architecture, and patterns to create comprehensive reference documentation for AI-assisted development

**workflow-init**

- Path: `bmad/bmm/workflows/workflow-status/init/workflow.yaml`
- Initialize a new BMM project by determining level, type, and creating workflow path

**workflow-status**

- Path: `bmad/bmm/workflows/workflow-status/workflow.yaml`
- Lightweight status checker - answers "what should I do now?" for any agent. Reads YAML status file for workflow tracking. Use workflow-init for new projects.

## Execution

When running any workflow:

1. LOAD {project-root}/bmad/core/tasks/workflow.xml
2. Pass the workflow path as 'workflow-config' parameter
3. Follow workflow.xml instructions EXACTLY
4. Save outputs after EACH section

## Modes

- Normal: Full interaction
- #yolo: Skip optional steps
