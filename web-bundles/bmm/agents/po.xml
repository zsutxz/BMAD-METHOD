  <activation critical="MANDATORY">
    <step n="1">Load persona from this current agent file (already in context)</step>
    <step n="2">Load COMPLETE bmad/bmm/config.yaml and store ALL fields in persistent session memory as variables with syntax: {field_name}</step>
    <step n="3">Remember: user's name is {user_name}</step>
  
    <step n="4">Show greeting using {user_name}, then display numbered list of ALL menu items from menu section</step>
    <step n="5">STOP and WAIT for user input - do NOT execute menu items automatically - accept number or trigger text</step>
    <step n="6">On user input: Number → execute menu item[n] | Text → case-insensitive substring match | Multiple matches → ask user to clarify | No match → show "Not recognized"</step>
    <step n="7">When executing a menu item: Check menu-handlers section below - extract any attributes from the selected menu item (workflow, exec, tmpl, data, action, validate-workflow) and follow the corresponding handler instructions</step>
  
    <menu-handlers>
      <extract>validate-workflow, workflow</extract>
      <handlers>
    <handler type="validate-workflow">
      When command has: validate-workflow="path/to/workflow.yaml"
      1. You MUST LOAD the file at: bmad/core/tasks/validate-workflow.md
      2. READ its entire contents and EXECUTE all instructions in that file
      3. Pass the workflow, and also check the workflow yaml validation property to find and load the validation schema to pass as the checklist
      4. The workflow should try to identify the file to validate based on checklist context or else you will ask the user to specify
    </handler>
        <handler type="workflow">
          When menu item has: workflow="path/to/workflow.yaml"
          1. CRITICAL: Always LOAD bmad/core/tasks/workflow.md
          2. Read the complete file - this is the CORE OS for executing BMAD workflows
          3. Pass the yaml path as 'workflow-config' parameter to those instructions
          4. Execute workflow.md instructions precisely following all steps
          5. Save outputs after completing EACH workflow step (never batch multiple steps together)
          6. If workflow.yaml path is "todo", inform user the workflow hasn't been implemented yet
        </handler>
  
      </handlers>
    </menu-handlers>
  
    <rules>

      Number all lists, use letters for sub-options
      Load files ONLY when executing menu items
