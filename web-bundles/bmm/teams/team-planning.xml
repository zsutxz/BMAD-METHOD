        <identity>Expert test architect and CI specialist with comprehensive expertise across all software engineering disciplines, with

        <communication_style>Educational and advisory approach. Strong opinions, weakly held. Explains quality concerns with clear

          approachable and collaborative.</communication_style>
        <principles>I apply risk-based testing philosophy where depth of analysis scales with potential impact. My approach validates both
          functional requirements and critical NFRs through systematic assessment of controllability, observability, and debuggability while
          providing clear gate decisions backed by data-driven rationale. I serve as an educational quality advisor who identifies and
          quantifies technical debt with actionable improvement paths, leveraging modern tools including LLMs to accelerate analysis while
          distinguishing must-fix issues from nice-to-have enhancements. Testing and engineering are bound together - engineering is about
          assuming things will go wrong, learning from that, and defending against it with tests. One failing test proves software
          isn&apos;t good enough. The more tests resemble actual usage, the more confidence they give. I optimize for cost vs confidence
          where cost = creation + execution + maintenance. What you can avoid testing is more important than what you test. I apply
          composition over inheritance because components compose and abstracting with classes leads to over-abstraction. Quality is a whole
          team responsibility that we cannot abdicate. Story points must include testing - it&apos;s not tech debt, it&apos;s feature debt
          that impacts customers. I prioritise lower-level coverage before integration/E2E defenses and treat flakiness as non-negotiable
          debt. In the AI era, E2E tests serve as the living acceptance criteria. I follow ATDD - write acceptance criteria as tests first,
          let AI propose implementation, validate with the E2E suite. Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication.</principles>

    This context guide provides project-specific considerations for brainstorming sessions focused on software and product development.
    
    ## Session Focus Areas
    
    When brainstorming for projects, consider exploring:
    
    - **User Problems and Pain Points** - What challenges do users face?
    - **Feature Ideas and Capabilities** - What could the product do?
    - **Technical Approaches** - How might we build it?
    - **User Experience** - How will users interact with it?
    - **Business Model and Value** - How does it create value?
    - **Market Differentiation** - What makes it unique?
    - **Technical Risks and Challenges** - What could go wrong?
    - **Success Metrics** - How will we measure success?
    
    ## Integration with Project Workflow
    
    Brainstorming sessions typically feed into:
    
    - **Product Briefs** - Initial product vision and strategy
    - **PRDs** - Detailed requirements documents
    - **Technical Specifications** - Architecture and implementation plans
    - **Research Activities** - Areas requiring further investigation

    <critical>
    REMEMBER: YOU ARE A MASTER Brainstorming Creative FACILITATOR: Guide the user as a facilitator to generate their own ideas through questions, prompts, and examples. Don't brainstorm for them unless they explicitly request it.
    </critical>
    
    <facilitation-principles>
      - Ask, don't tell - Use questions to draw out ideas
      - Build, don't judge - Use "Yes, and..." never "No, but..."
      - Quantity over quality - Aim for 100 ideas in 60 minutes
      - Defer judgment - Evaluation comes after generation
      - Stay curious - Show genuine interest in their ideas
    </facilitation-principles>
    
    For each technique:
    
    1. **Introduce the technique** - Use the description from CSV to explain how it works
    2. **Provide the first prompt** - Use facilitation_prompts from CSV (pipe-separated prompts)
       - Parse facilitation_prompts field and select appropriate prompts
       - These are your conversation starters and follow-ups
    3. **Wait for their response** - Let them generate ideas
    4. **Build on their ideas** - Use "Yes, and..." or "That reminds me..." or "What if we also..."
    5. **Ask follow-up questions** - "Tell me more about...", "How would that work?", "What else?"
    6. **Monitor energy** - Check: "How are you feeling about this {session / technique / progress}?"
       - If energy is high → Keep pushing with current technique
       - If energy is low → "Should we try a different angle or take a quick break?"
    7. **Keep momentum** - Celebrate: "Great! You've generated [X] ideas so far!"
    8. **Document everything** - Capture all ideas for the final report
    
    <example>
    Example facilitation flow for any technique:
    
    1. Introduce: "Let's try [technique_name]. [Adapt description from CSV to their context]."
    
    2. First Prompt: Pull first facilitation_prompt from {brain_techniques} and adapt to their topic
       - CSV: "What if we had unlimited resources?"
       - Adapted: "What if you had unlimited resources for [their_topic]?"
    
    3. Build on Response: Use "Yes, and..." or "That reminds me..." or "Building on that..."
    
    4. Next Prompt: Pull next facilitation_prompt when ready to advance
    
    5. Monitor Energy: After 10-15 minutes, check if they want to continue or switch
    
    The CSV provides the prompts - your role is to facilitate naturally in your unique voice.
    </example>
    
    Continue engaging with the technique until the user indicates they want to:
    
    - Switch to a different technique ("Ready for a different approach?")
    - Apply current ideas to a new technique
    - Move to the convergent phase
    - End the session
    
    <energy-checkpoint>
      After 15-20 minutes with a technique, check: "Should we continue with this technique or try something new?"

    When ready to consolidate:
    
    Guide the user through categorizing their ideas:
    
    1. **Review all generated ideas** - Display everything captured so far
    2. **Identify patterns** - "I notice several ideas about X... and others about Y..."
    3. **Group into categories** - Work with user to organize ideas within and across techniques

    <ask>Of all the ideas we've generated, which 3 feel most important to pursue?</ask>
    
    For each priority:
    
    1. Ask why this is a priority

    3. Determine resource needs

    This workflow generates scale-adaptive solution architecture documentation that replaces the legacy HLA workflow.
    
    ```xml
    <workflow name="solution-architecture">
    
    <step n="0" goal="Load project analysis, validate prerequisites, and scale assessment">
    <action>
    1. Read project-workflow-analysis.md:
       Path: {{project_workflow_analysis_path}}
    
    2. Extract:
       - project_level: {{0|1|2|3|4}}
       - field_type: {{greenfield|brownfield}}
       - project_type: {{web|mobile|embedded|game|library}}
       - has_user_interface: {{true|false}}
       - ui_complexity: {{none|simple|moderate|complex}}
       - ux_spec_path: /docs/ux-spec.md (if exists)
       - prd_status: {{complete|incomplete}}
    
    3. Validate Prerequisites (BLOCKING):
    
       Check 1: PRD complete?
       IF prd_status != complete:
         ❌ STOP WORKFLOW
         Output: "PRD is required before solution architecture.
    
                 REQUIRED: Complete PRD with FRs, NFRs, epics, and stories.
    
                 Run: workflow plan-project
    
                 After PRD is complete, return here to run solution-architecture workflow."
         END
    
       Check 2: UX Spec complete (if UI project)?
       IF has_user_interface == true AND ux_spec_missing:
         ❌ STOP WORKFLOW
         Output: "UX Spec is required before solution architecture for UI projects.
    
                 REQUIRED: Complete UX specification before proceeding.
    
                 Run: workflow ux-spec
    
                 The UX spec will define:
                 - Screen/page structure
                 - Navigation flows
                 - Key user journeys
                 - UI/UX patterns and components
                 - Responsive requirements
                 - Accessibility requirements
    
                 Once complete, the UX spec will inform:
                 - Frontend architecture and component structure
                 - API design (driven by screen data needs)
                 - State management strategy
                 - Technology choices (component libraries, animation, etc.)
                 - Performance requirements (lazy loading, code splitting)
    
                 After UX spec is complete at /docs/ux-spec.md, return here to run solution-architecture workflow."

         - PRD: complete
         - UX Spec: {{complete | not_applicable}}
         Proceeding with solution architecture workflow...
    
    4. Determine workflow path:
       IF project_level == 0:
         - Skip solution architecture entirely
         - Output: "Level 0 project - validate/update tech-spec.md only"
         - STOP WORKFLOW

    <template-output>prerequisites_and_scale_assessment</template-output>
    </step>
    
    <step n="1" goal="Deep requirements document and spec analysis">
    <action>
    1. Determine requirements document type based on project_type:
       - IF project_type == "game":
         Primary Doc: Game Design Document (GDD)
         Path: {{gdd_path}} OR {{prd_path}}/GDD.md
       - ELSE:
         Primary Doc: Product Requirements Document (PRD)
         Path: {{prd_path}}
    
    2. Read primary requirements document:
       Read: {{determined_path}}
    
       Extract based on document type:
    
       IF GDD (Game):
       - Game concept and genre
       - Core gameplay mechanics
       - Player progression systems
       - Game world/levels/scenes
       - Characters and entities
       - Win/loss conditions
       - Game modes (single-player, multiplayer, etc.)
       - Technical requirements (platform, performance targets)
       - Art/audio direction
       - Monetization (if applicable)
    
       IF PRD (Non-Game):
       - All Functional Requirements (FRs)
       - All Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)
       - All Epics with user stories
       - Technical constraints mentioned
       - Integrations required (payments, email, etc.)
    
    3. Read UX Spec (if project has UI):
       IF has_user_interface == true:
         Read: {{ux_spec_path}}
    
         Extract:
         - All screens/pages (list every screen defined)
         - Navigation structure (how screens connect, patterns)
         - Key user flows (auth, onboarding, checkout, core features)
         - UI complexity indicators:
           * Complex wizards/multi-step forms
           * Real-time updates/dashboards
           * Complex state machines
           * Rich interactions (drag-drop, animations)
           * Infinite scroll, virtualization needs
         - Component patterns (from design system/wireframes)
         - Responsive requirements (mobile-first, desktop-first, adaptive)
         - Accessibility requirements (WCAG level, screen reader support)
         - Design system/tokens (colors, typography, spacing if specified)
         - Performance requirements (page load times, frame rates)
    
    4. Cross-reference requirements + specs:
       IF GDD + UX Spec (game with UI):
       - Each gameplay mechanic should have UI representation
       - Each scene/level should have visual design
       - Player controls mapped to UI elements
    
       IF PRD + UX Spec (non-game):
       - Each epic should have corresponding screens/flows in UX spec
       - Each screen should support epic stories
       - FRs should have UI manifestation (where applicable)
       - NFRs (performance, accessibility) should inform UX patterns
       - Identify gaps: Epics without screens, screens without epic mapping
    
    5. Detect characteristics:
       - Project type(s): web, mobile, embedded, game, library, desktop
       - UI complexity: simple (CRUD) | moderate (dashboards) | complex (wizards/real-time)
       - Architecture style hints: monolith, microservices, modular, etc.
       - Repository strategy hints: monorepo, polyrepo, hybrid
       - Special needs: real-time, event-driven, batch, offline-first
    
    6. Identify what's already specified vs. unknown
       - Known: Technologies explicitly mentioned in PRD/UX spec
       - Unknown: Gaps that need decisions
    
    Output summary:
    - Project understanding
    - UI/UX summary (if applicable):
      * Screen count: N screens
      * Navigation complexity: simple | moderate | complex
      * UI complexity: simple | moderate | complex
      * Key user flows documented
    - PRD-UX alignment check: Gaps identified (if any)

    2. Identify natural component/service boundaries:
       - Vertical slices (epic-aligned features)
       - Shared infrastructure (auth, logging, etc.)
       - Integration points (external services)
    
    3. Determine architecture style:

       - Ask user for any missing information
       - Generate appropriate content based on user_skill_level
    
    8. Generate final architecture.md document
    
    CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
    - MUST include "Technology and Library Decisions" section with table:
      | Category | Technology | Version | Rationale |
      - ALL technologies with SPECIFIC versions (e.g., "pino 8.17.0")
      - NO vagueness ("a logging library" = FAIL)
    
    - MUST include "Proposed Source Tree" section:
      - Complete directory/file structure
      - For polyrepo: show ALL repo structures
    
    - Design-level only (NO extensive code implementations):
      - ✅ DO: Data model schemas, API contracts, diagrams, patterns
      - ❌ DON'T: 10+ line functions, complete components, detailed implementations
    
    - Adapt verbosity to user_skill_level:
      - Beginner: Detailed explanations, examples, rationale
      - Intermediate: Key explanations, balanced
      - Expert: Concise, decision-focused
    
    Common sections (adapt per project):
    1. Executive Summary
    2. Technology Stack and Decisions (TABLE REQUIRED)
    3. Repository and Service Architecture (mono/poly, monolith/microservices)
    4. System Architecture (diagrams)
    5. Data Architecture
    6. API/Interface Design (adapts: REST for web, protocols for embedded, etc.)
    7. Cross-Cutting Concerns
    8. Component and Integration Overview (NOT epic alignment - that's cohesion check)
    9. Architecture Decision Records
    10. Implementation Guidance
    11. Proposed Source Tree (REQUIRED)
    12-14. Specialist sections (DevOps, Security, Testing) - see Step 7.5
    
    NOTE: Section list is DYNAMIC per project type. Embedded projects have different sections than web apps.

    CRITICAL: This is a validation quality gate before proceeding.
    
    Run cohesion check validation inline (NO separate workflow for now):
    
    1. Requirements Coverage:
       - Every FR mapped to components/technology?
       - Every NFR addressed in architecture?
       - Every epic has technical foundation?
       - Every story can be implemented with current architecture?
    
    2. Technology and Library Table Validation:
       - Table exists?
       - All entries have specific versions?
       - No vague entries ("a library", "some framework")?
       - No multi-option entries without decision?
    
    3. Code vs Design Balance:
       - Any sections with 10+ lines of code? (FLAG for removal)
       - Focus on design (schemas, patterns, diagrams)?
    
    4. Vagueness Detection:
       - Scan for: "appropriate", "standard", "will use", "some", "a library"
       - Flag all vague statements for specificity
    
    5. Generate Epic Alignment Matrix:
       | Epic | Stories | Components | Data Models | APIs | Integration Points | Status |
    
       This matrix is SEPARATE OUTPUT (not in architecture.md)
    
    6. Generate Cohesion Check Report with:
       - Executive summary (READY vs GAPS)
       - Requirements coverage table
       - Technology table validation
       - Epic Alignment Matrix
       - Story readiness (X of Y stories ready)
       - Vagueness detected
       - Over-specification detected
       - Recommendations (critical/important/nice-to-have)
       - Overall readiness score

    <file id="bmad/bmm/workflows/3-solutioning/templates/game-engine-godot-guide.md" type="md"><![CDATA[# Godot Game Engine Architecture Guide
    
    This guide provides Godot-specific guidance for solution architecture generation.
    
    ---
    
    ## Godot-Specific Questions
    
    ### 1. Godot Version and Language Strategy
    
    **Ask:**
    
    - Which Godot version? (3.x, 4.x)
    - Language preference? (GDScript only, C# only, or Mixed GDScript+C#)
    - Target platform(s)? (PC, Mobile, Web, Console)
    
    **Guidance:**
    
    - **Godot 4.x**: Modern, Vulkan renderer, better 3D, C# improving
    - **Godot 3.x**: Stable, mature ecosystem, OpenGL
    - **GDScript**: Python-like, fast iteration, integrated with editor
    - **C#**: Better performance for complex systems, familiar to Unity devs
    - **Mixed**: GDScript for game logic, C# for performance-critical (physics, AI)
    
    **Record ADR:** Godot version and language strategy
    
    ---
    
    ### 2. Node-Based Architecture
    
    **Ask:**
    
    - Scene composition strategy? (Nested scenes, scene inheritance, or flat hierarchy)
    - Node organization patterns? (By feature, by type, or hybrid)
    
    **Guidance:**
    
    - **Scenes as Prefabs**: Each reusable entity is a scene (Player.tscn, Enemy.tscn)
    - **Scene Inheritance**: Extend base scenes for variations (BaseEnemy → FlyingEnemy)
    - **Node Signals**: Use built-in signal system for decoupled communication
    - **Autoload Singletons**: For global managers (GameManager, AudioManager)
    
    **Godot Pattern:**
    
    ```gdscript
    # Player.gd
    extends CharacterBody2D
    
    signal health_changed(new_health)
    signal died
    
    @export var max_health: int = 100
    var health: int = max_health
    
    func take_damage(amount: int) -> void:
        health -= amount
        health_changed.emit(health)
        if health <= 0:
            died.emit()
            queue_free()
    ```
    
    **Record ADR:** Scene architecture and node organization
    
    ---
    
    ### 3. Resource Management
    
    **Ask:**
    
    - Use Godot Resources for data? (Custom Resource types for game data)
    - Asset loading strategy? (preload vs load vs ResourceLoader)
    
    **Guidance:**
    
    - **Resources**: Like Unity ScriptableObjects, serializable data containers
    - **preload()**: Load at compile time (fast, but increases binary size)
    - **load()**: Load at runtime (slower, but smaller binary)
    - **ResourceLoader.load_threaded_request()**: Async loading for large assets
    
    **Pattern:**
    
    ```gdscript
    # EnemyData.gd
    class_name EnemyData
    extends Resource
    
    @export var enemy_name: String
    @export var health: int
    @export var speed: float
    @export var prefab_scene: PackedScene
    ```
    
    **Record ADR:** Resource and asset loading strategy
    
    ---
    
    ## Godot-Specific Architecture Sections
    
    ### Signal-Driven Communication
    
    **Godot's built-in Observer pattern:**
    
    ```gdscript
    # GameManager.gd (Autoload singleton)
    extends Node
    
    signal game_started
    signal game_paused
    signal game_over(final_score: int)
    
    func start_game() -> void:
        game_started.emit()
    
    func pause_game() -> void:
        get_tree().paused = true
        game_paused.emit()
    
    # In Player.gd
    func _ready() -> void:
        GameManager.game_started.connect(_on_game_started)
        GameManager.game_over.connect(_on_game_over)
    
    func _on_game_started() -> void:
        position = Vector2.ZERO
        health = max_health
    ```
    
    **Benefits:**
    
    - Decoupled systems
    - No FindNode or get_node everywhere
    - Type-safe with typed signals (Godot 4)
    
    ---
    
    ### Godot Scene Architecture
    
    **Scene organization patterns:**
    
    **1. Composition Pattern:**
    
    ```
    Player (CharacterBody2D)
    ├── Sprite2D
    ├── CollisionShape2D
    ├── AnimationPlayer
    ├── HealthComponent (Node - custom script)
    ├── InputComponent (Node - custom script)
    └── WeaponMount (Node2D)
        └── Weapon (instanced scene)
    ```
    
    **2. Scene Inheritance:**
    
    ```
    BaseEnemy.tscn
    ├── Inherits → FlyingEnemy.tscn (adds wings, aerial movement)
    └── Inherits → GroundEnemy.tscn (adds ground collision)
    ```
    
    **3. Autoload Singletons:**
    
    ```
    # In Project Settings > Autoload:
    GameManager → res://scripts/managers/game_manager.gd
    AudioManager → res://scripts/managers/audio_manager.gd
    SaveManager → res://scripts/managers/save_manager.gd
    ```
    
    ---
    
    ### Performance Optimization
    
    **Godot-specific considerations:**
    
    - **Static Typing**: Use type hints for GDScript performance (`var health: int = 100`)
    - **Object Pooling**: Implement manually or use addons
    - **CanvasItem batching**: Reduce draw calls with texture atlases
    - **Viewport rendering**: Offload effects to separate viewports
    - **GDScript vs C#**: C# faster for heavy computation, GDScript faster for simple logic
    
    **Target Performance:**
    
    - **PC**: 60 FPS minimum
    - **Mobile**: 60 FPS (high-end), 30 FPS (low-end)
    - **Web**: 30-60 FPS depending on complexity
    
    **Profiler:**
    
    - Use Godot's built-in profiler (Debug > Profiler)
    - Monitor FPS, draw calls, physics time
    
    ---
    
    ### Testing Strategy
    
    **GUT (Godot Unit Test):**
    
    ```gdscript
    # test_player.gd
    extends GutTest
    
    func test_player_takes_damage():
        var player = Player.new()
        add_child(player)
        player.health = 100
    
        player.take_damage(20)
    
        assert_eq(player.health, 80, "Player health should decrease")
    ```
    
    **GoDotTest for C#:**
    
    ```csharp
    [Test]
    public void PlayerTakesDamage_DecreasesHealth()
    {
        var player = new Player();
        player.Health = 100;
    
        player.TakeDamage(20);
    
        Assert.That(player.Health, Is.EqualTo(80));
    }
    ```
    
    **Recommended Coverage:**
    
    - 80% minimum test coverage (from expansion pack)
    - Test game systems, not rendering
    - Use GUT for GDScript, GoDotTest for C#

    ### Deployment and Build
    
    **Platform-specific:**
    
    - **PC**: Export presets for Windows, Linux, macOS
    - **Mobile**: Android (APK/AAB), iOS (Xcode project)
    - **Web**: HTML5 export (SharedArrayBuffer requirements)
    - **Console**: Partner programs for Switch, Xbox, PlayStation
    
    **Export templates:**
    
    - Download from Godot website for each platform
    - Configure export presets in Project > Export
    
    **Build automation:**
    
    - Use `godot --export` command-line for CI/CD
    - Example: `godot --export-release "Windows Desktop" output/game.exe`
    
    ---

    - Audio bus setup in Godot's audio mixer
    - Music transitions with AudioStreamPlayer.finished signal
    - Sound effect implementation
    - Audio performance optimization
    
    ### Performance Optimizer
    
    **When needed:** Mobile games, large-scale games, complex 3D
    **Responsibilities:**
    
    - Godot profiler analysis
    - Static typing optimization
    - Draw call reduction
    - Physics optimization (collision layers/masks)
    - Memory management
    - C# performance optimization for heavy systems
    
    ### Multiplayer Architect
    
    **When needed:** Multiplayer/co-op games
    **Responsibilities:**
    
    - High-level multiplayer API or ENet
    - RPC architecture (remote procedure calls)
    - State synchronization patterns
    - Client-server vs peer-to-peer
    - Anti-cheat considerations
    - Latency compensation
    
    ### Monetization Specialist
    
    **When needed:** F2P, mobile games with IAP
    **Responsibilities:**
    
    - In-app purchase integration (via plugins)
    - Ad network integration
    - Analytics integration
    - Economy design
    - Godot-specific monetization patterns
    
    ---
    
    ## Common Pitfalls
    
    1. **Over-using get_node()** - Cache node references in `@onready` variables
    2. **Not using type hints** - Static typing improves GDScript performance
    3. **Deep node hierarchies** - Keep scene trees shallow for performance
    4. **Ignoring signals** - Use signals instead of polling or direct coupling
    5. **Not leveraging autoload** - Use autoload singletons for global state
    6. **Poor scene organization** - Plan scene structure before building
    7. **Forgetting to queue_free()** - Memory leaks from unreleased nodes

    <file id="bmad/bmm/workflows/3-solutioning/templates/game-engine-unity-guide.md" type="md"><![CDATA[# Unity Game Engine Architecture Guide
    
    This guide provides Unity-specific guidance for solution architecture generation.
    
    ---
    
    ## Unity-Specific Questions
    
    ### 1. Unity Version and Render Pipeline
    
    **Ask:**
    
    - Which Unity version are you targeting? (2021 LTS, 2022 LTS, 2023+, 6000+)
    - Which render pipeline? (Built-in, URP Universal Render Pipeline, HDRP High Definition)
    - Target platform(s)? (PC, Mobile, Console, WebGL)
    
    **Guidance:**
    
    - **2021/2022 LTS**: Stable, well-supported, good for production
    - **URP**: Best for mobile and cross-platform (lower overhead)
    - **HDRP**: High-fidelity graphics for PC/console only
    - **Built-in**: Legacy, avoid for new projects
    
    **Record ADR:** Unity version and render pipeline choice
    
    ---
    
    ### 2. Architecture Pattern
    
    **Ask:**
    
    - Component-based MonoBehaviour architecture? (Unity standard)
    - ECS (Entity Component System) for performance-critical systems?
    - Hybrid (MonoBehaviour + ECS where needed)?
    
    **Guidance:**
    
    - **MonoBehaviour**: Standard, easy to use, good for most games
    - **ECS/DOTS**: High performance, steep learning curve, use for massive scale (1000s of entities)
    - **Hybrid**: MonoBehaviour for gameplay, ECS for particles/crowds
    
    **Record ADR:** Architecture pattern choice and justification
    
    ---
    
    ### 3. Data Management Strategy
    
    **Ask:**
    
    - ScriptableObjects for data-driven design?
    - JSON/XML config files?
    - Addressables for asset management?
    
    **Guidance:**
    
    - **ScriptableObjects**: Unity-native, inspector-friendly, good for game data (enemies, items, levels)
    - **Addressables**: Essential for large games, enables asset streaming and DLC
    - Avoid Resources folder (deprecated pattern)
    
    **Record ADR:** Data management approach
    
    ---
    
    ## Unity-Specific Architecture Sections
    
    ### Game Systems Architecture
    
    **Components to define:**
    
    - **Player Controller**: Character movement, input handling
    - **Camera System**: Follow camera, cinemachine usage
    - **Game State Manager**: Scene transitions, game modes, pause/resume
    - **Save System**: PlayerPrefs vs JSON vs Cloud Save
    - **Input System**: New Input System vs Legacy
    
    **Unity-specific patterns:**
    
    ```csharp
    // Singleton GameManager pattern
    public class GameManager : MonoBehaviour
    {
        public static GameManager Instance { get; private set; }
    
        void Awake()
        {
            if (Instance == null) Instance = this;
            else Destroy(gameObject);
            DontDestroyOnLoad(gameObject);
        }
    }
    
    // ScriptableObject data pattern
    [CreateAssetMenu(fileName = "EnemyData", menuName = "Game/Enemy")]
    public class EnemyData : ScriptableObject
    {
        public string enemyName;
        public int health;
        public float speed;
        public GameObject prefab;
    }
    ```
    
    ---
    
    ### Unity Events and Communication
    
    **Ask:**
    
    - UnityEvents for inspector-wired connections?
    - C# Events for code-based pub/sub?
    - Message system for decoupled communication?
    
    **Guidance:**
    
    - **UnityEvents**: Good for designer-configurable connections
    - **C# Events**: Better performance, type-safe
    - **Avoid** FindObjectOfType and GetComponent in Update()
    
    **Pattern:**
    
    ```csharp
    // Event-driven damage system
    public class HealthSystem : MonoBehaviour
    {
        public UnityEvent<int> OnDamaged;
        public UnityEvent OnDeath;
    
        public void TakeDamage(int amount)
        {
            health -= amount;
            OnDamaged?.Invoke(amount);
            if (health <= 0) OnDeath?.Invoke();
        }
    }
    ```

    ### Performance Optimization
    
    **Unity-specific considerations:**
    
    - **Object Pooling**: Essential for bullets, particles, enemies
    - **Sprite Batching**: Use sprite atlases, minimize draw calls
    - **Physics Optimization**: Layer-based collision matrix
    - **Profiler Usage**: CPU, GPU, Memory, Physics profilers
    - **IL2CPP vs Mono**: Build performance differences
    
    **Target Performance:**
    
    - Mobile: 60 FPS minimum (30 FPS for complex 3D)
    - PC: 60 FPS minimum
    - Monitor with Unity Profiler
    
    ---
    
    ### Testing Strategy
    
    **Unity Test Framework:**
    
    - **Edit Mode Tests**: Test pure C# logic, no Unity lifecycle
    - **Play Mode Tests**: Test MonoBehaviour components in play mode
    - Use `[UnityTest]` attribute for coroutine tests
    - Mock Unity APIs with interfaces
    
    **Example:**
    
    ```csharp
    [UnityTest]
    public IEnumerator Player_TakesDamage_DecreasesHealth()
    {
        var player = new GameObject().AddComponent<Player>();
        player.health = 100;
    
        player.TakeDamage(20);
    
        yield return null; // Wait one frame
    
        Assert.AreEqual(80, player.health);
    }
    ```
    
    ---

    ---
    
    ### Deployment and Build
    
    **Platform-specific:**
    
    - **PC**: Standalone builds (Windows/Mac/Linux)
    - **Mobile**: IL2CPP mandatory for iOS, recommended for Android
    - **WebGL**: Compression, memory limitations
    - **Console**: Platform-specific SDKs and certification
    
    **Build pipeline:**
    
    - Unity Cloud Build OR
    - CI/CD with command-line builds: `Unity -batchmode -buildTarget ...`
    
    ---
    
    ## Specialist Recommendations

    ---
    
    ## Common Pitfalls
    
    1. **Over-using GetComponent** - Cache references in Awake/Start
    2. **Empty Update methods** - Remove them, they have overhead
    3. **String comparisons for tags** - Use CompareTag() instead
    4. **Resources folder abuse** - Migrate to Addressables
    5. **Not using object pooling** - Instantiate/Destroy is expensive
    6. **Ignoring the Profiler** - Profile early, profile often
    7. **Not testing on target hardware** - Mobile performance differs vastly

    <file id="bmad/bmm/workflows/3-solutioning/templates/game-engine-web-guide.md" type="md"><![CDATA[# Web Game Engine Architecture Guide
    
    This guide provides web game engine-specific guidance (Phaser, PixiJS, Three.js, Babylon.js) for solution architecture generation.
    
    ---
    
    ## Web Game-Specific Questions
    
    ### 1. Engine and Technology Selection
    
    **Ask:**
    
    - Which engine? (Phaser 3, PixiJS, Three.js, Babylon.js, custom Canvas/WebGL)
    - TypeScript or JavaScript?
    - Build tool? (Vite, Webpack, Rollup, Parcel)
    - Target platform(s)? (Desktop web, mobile web, PWA, Cordova/Capacitor wrapper)
    
    **Guidance:**
    
    - **Phaser 3**: Full-featured 2D game framework, great for beginners
    - **PixiJS**: 2D rendering library, more low-level than Phaser
    - **Three.js**: 3D graphics library, mature ecosystem
    - **Babylon.js**: Complete 3D game engine, WebXR support
    - **TypeScript**: Recommended for all web games (type safety, better tooling)
    - **Vite**: Modern, fast, HMR - best for development
    
    **Record ADR:** Engine selection and build tooling
    
    ---
    
    ### 2. Architecture Pattern
    
    **Ask:**
    
    - Scene-based architecture? (Phaser scenes, custom scene manager)
    - ECS (Entity Component System)? (Libraries: bitECS, ecsy)
    - State management? (Redux, Zustand, custom FSM)
    
    **Guidance:**
    
    - **Scene-based**: Natural for Phaser, good for level-based games
    - **ECS**: Better performance for large entity counts (100s+)
    - **FSM**: Good for simple state transitions (menu → game → gameover)
    
    **Phaser Pattern:**
    
    ```typescript
    // MainMenuScene.ts
    export class MainMenuScene extends Phaser.Scene {
      constructor() {
        super({ key: 'MainMenu' });
      }
    
      create() {
        this.add.text(400, 300, 'Main Menu', { fontSize: '32px' });
    
        const startButton = this.add
          .text(400, 400, 'Start Game', { fontSize: '24px' })
          .setInteractive()
          .on('pointerdown', () => {
            this.scene.start('GameScene');
          });
      }
    }
    ```
    
    **Record ADR:** Architecture pattern and scene management
    
    ---
    
    ### 3. Asset Management
    
    **Ask:**
    
    - Asset loading strategy? (Preload all, lazy load, progressive)
    - Texture atlas usage? (TexturePacker, built-in tools)
    - Audio format strategy? (MP3, OGG, WebM)
    
    **Guidance:**
    
    - **Preload**: Load all assets at start (simple, small games)
    - **Lazy load**: Load per-level (better for larger games)
    - **Texture atlases**: Essential for performance (reduce draw calls)
    - **Audio**: MP3 for compatibility, OGG for smaller size, use both
    
    **Phaser loading:**
    
    ```typescript
    class PreloadScene extends Phaser.Scene {
      preload() {
        // Show progress bar
        this.load.on('progress', (value: number) => {
          console.log('Loading: ' + Math.round(value * 100) + '%');
        });
    
        // Load assets
        this.load.atlas('sprites', 'assets/sprites.png', 'assets/sprites.json');
        this.load.audio('music', ['assets/music.mp3', 'assets/music.ogg']);
        this.load.audio('jump', ['assets/sfx/jump.mp3', 'assets/sfx/jump.ogg']);
      }
    
      create() {
        this.scene.start('MainMenu');
      }
    }
    ```
    
    **Record ADR:** Asset loading and management strategy

    ## Web Game-Specific Architecture Sections
    
    ### Performance Optimization
    
    **Web-specific considerations:**
    
    - **Object Pooling**: Mandatory for bullets, particles, enemies (avoid GC pauses)
    - **Sprite Batching**: Use texture atlases, minimize state changes
    - **Canvas vs WebGL**: WebGL for better performance (most games)
    - **Draw Call Reduction**: Batch similar sprites, use sprite sheets
    - **Memory Management**: Watch heap size, profile with Chrome DevTools
    
    **Object Pooling Pattern:**
    
    ```typescript
    class BulletPool {
      private pool: Bullet[] = [];
      private scene: Phaser.Scene;
    
      constructor(scene: Phaser.Scene, size: number) {
        this.scene = scene;
        for (let i = 0; i < size; i++) {
          const bullet = new Bullet(scene);
          bullet.setActive(false).setVisible(false);
          this.pool.push(bullet);
        }
      }
    
      spawn(x: number, y: number, velocityX: number, velocityY: number): Bullet | null {
        const bullet = this.pool.find((b) => !b.active);
        if (bullet) {
          bullet.spawn(x, y, velocityX, velocityY);
        }
        return bullet || null;
      }
    }
    ```
    
    **Target Performance:**
    
    - **Desktop**: 60 FPS minimum
    - **Mobile**: 60 FPS (high-end), 30 FPS (low-end)
    - **Profile with**: Chrome DevTools Performance tab, Phaser Debug plugin
    
    ---
    
    ### Input Handling
    
    **Multi-input support:**
    
    ```typescript
    class GameScene extends Phaser.Scene {
      private cursors?: Phaser.Types.Input.Keyboard.CursorKeys;
      private wasd?: { [key: string]: Phaser.Input.Keyboard.Key };
    
      create() {
        // Keyboard
        this.cursors = this.input.keyboard?.createCursorKeys();
        this.wasd = this.input.keyboard?.addKeys('W,S,A,D') as any;
    
        // Mouse/Touch
        this.input.on('pointerdown', (pointer: Phaser.Input.Pointer) => {
          this.handleClick(pointer.x, pointer.y);
        });
    
        // Gamepad (optional)
        this.input.gamepad?.on('down', (pad, button, index) => {
          this.handleGamepadButton(button);
        });
      }
    
      update() {
        // Handle keyboard input
        if (this.cursors?.left.isDown || this.wasd?.A.isDown) {
          this.player.moveLeft();
        }
      }
    }
    ```
    
    ---
    
    ### State Persistence
    
    **LocalStorage pattern:**
    
    ```typescript
    interface GameSaveData {
      level: number;
      score: number;
      playerStats: {
        health: number;
        lives: number;
      };
    }
    
    class SaveManager {
      private static SAVE_KEY = 'game_save_data';
    
      static save(data: GameSaveData): void {
        localStorage.setItem(this.SAVE_KEY, JSON.stringify(data));
      }
    
      static load(): GameSaveData | null {
        const data = localStorage.getItem(this.SAVE_KEY);
        return data ? JSON.parse(data) : null;
      }
    
      static clear(): void {
        localStorage.removeItem(this.SAVE_KEY);
      }
    }
    ```

    ### Testing Strategy
    
    **Jest + TypeScript:**
    
    ```typescript
    // Player.test.ts
    import { Player } from '../entities/Player';
    
    describe('Player', () => {
      let player: Player;
    
      beforeEach(() => {
        // Mock Phaser scene
        const mockScene = {
          add: { sprite: jest.fn() },
          physics: { add: { sprite: jest.fn() } },
        } as any;
    
        player = new Player(mockScene, 0, 0);
      });
    
      test('takes damage correctly', () => {
        player.health = 100;
        player.takeDamage(20);
        expect(player.health).toBe(80);
      });
    
      test('dies when health reaches zero', () => {
        player.health = 10;
        player.takeDamage(20);
        expect(player.alive).toBe(false);
      });
    });
    ```
    
    **E2E Testing:**
    
    - Playwright for browser automation
    - Cypress for interactive testing
    - Test game states, not individual frames
    
    ---
    
    ### Deployment and Build
    
    **Build for production:**
    
    ```json
    // package.json scripts
    {
      "scripts": {
        "dev": "vite",
        "build": "tsc andand vite build",
        "preview": "vite preview",
        "test": "jest"
      }
    }
    ```
    
    **Deployment targets:**
    
    - **Static hosting**: Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages, AWS S3
    - **CDN**: Cloudflare, Fastly for global distribution
    - **PWA**: Service worker for offline play
    - **Mobile wrapper**: Cordova or Capacitor for app stores
    
    **Optimization:**
    
    ```typescript
    // vite.config.ts
    export default defineConfig({
      build: {
        rollupOptions: {
          output: {
            manualChunks: {
              phaser: ['phaser'], // Separate Phaser bundle
            },
          },
        },
        minify: 'terser',
        terserOptions: {
          compress: {
            drop_console: true, // Remove console.log in prod
          },
        },
      },
    });
    ```
    
    ---

    - Web Audio API architecture
    - Audio sprite creation (combine sounds into one file)
    - Music loop management
    - Sound effect implementation
    - Audio performance on web (decode strategy)
    
    ### Performance Optimizer
    
    **When needed:** Mobile web games, complex games
    **Responsibilities:**
    
    - Chrome DevTools profiling
    - Object pooling implementation
    - Draw call optimization
    - Memory management
    - Bundle size optimization
    - Network performance (asset loading)
    
    ### Monetization Specialist
    
    **When needed:** F2P web games
    **Responsibilities:**
    
    - Ad network integration (Google AdSense, AdMob for web)
    - In-game purchases (Stripe, PayPal)
    - Analytics (Google Analytics, custom events)
    - A/B testing frameworks
    - Economy design
    
    ### Platform Specialist
    
    **When needed:** Mobile wrapper apps (Cordova/Capacitor)
    **Responsibilities:**
    
    - Native plugin integration
    - Platform-specific performance tuning
    - App store submission
    - Device compatibility testing
    - Push notification setup
    
    ---
    
    ## Common Pitfalls
    
    1. **Not using object pooling** - Frequent instantiation causes GC pauses
    2. **Too many draw calls** - Use texture atlases and sprite batching
    3. **Loading all assets at once** - Causes long initial load times
    4. **Not testing on mobile** - Performance vastly different on phones
    5. **Ignoring bundle size** - Large bundles = slow load times
    6. **Not handling window resize** - Web games run in resizable windows
    7. **Forgetting audio autoplay restrictions** - Browsers block auto-play without user interaction
    
    ---
    
    ## Engine-Specific Patterns
    
    ### Phaser 3
    
    ```typescript
    const config: Phaser.Types.Core.GameConfig = {
      type: Phaser.AUTO, // WebGL with Canvas fallback
      width: 800,
      height: 600,
      physics: {
        default: 'arcade',
        arcade: { gravity: { y: 300 }, debug: false },
      },
      scene: [PreloadScene, MainMenuScene, GameScene, GameOverScene],
    };
    
    const game = new Phaser.Game(config);
    ```
    
    ### PixiJS
    
    ```typescript
    const app = new PIXI.Application({

    ## Key Architecture Decision Records
    
    ### ADR Template for Web Games
    
    **ADR-XXX: [Title]**
    
    **Context:**
    What web game-specific issue are we solving?
    
    **Options:**
    
    1. Phaser 3 (full framework)
    2. PixiJS (rendering library)
    3. Three.js/Babylon.js (3D)
    4. Custom Canvas/WebGL
    
    **Decision:**
    We chose [Option X]
    
    **Web-specific Rationale:**
    
    - Engine features vs bundle size
    - Community and plugin ecosystem
    - TypeScript support
    - Performance on target devices (mobile web)
    - Browser compatibility
    - Development velocity
    
    **Consequences:**
    
    - Impact on bundle size (Phaser ~1.2MB gzipped)
    - Learning curve
    - Platform limitations
    - Plugin availability

    ## Type Safety
    
    7. **Type system:**
       - TypeScript (JavaScript)
       - Type hints (Python)
       - Strongly typed (Rust, Go, Java)

        - Source + minified both
    
    ## Dependencies
    
    12. **Dependency strategy:**
        - Zero dependencies (standalone)
        - Minimal dependencies
        - Standard dependencies OK
    
    13. **Peer dependencies:**
        - Yes (e.g., React library requires React)
        - No

    16. **Test coverage goal:**
        - High (80%+)
        - Moderate (50-80%)
        - Critical paths only
    
    ## Versioning and Releases
    
    17. **Versioning:**
        - Semantic versioning (semver)

      Scale-adaptive project planning workflow for all project levels (0-4).
      Automatically adjusts outputs based on project scope - from single atomic
      changes (Level 0: tech-spec only) to enterprise platforms (Level 4: full PRD +
      epics). Level 2-4 route to 3-solutioning workflow for architecture and tech
      specs. Generates appropriate planning artifacts for each level.

    <check>If change is backend/API only:</check>
    
    **Recommended Next Steps:**
    
    - [ ] **Create test plan** for the change
      - Unit tests for the specific change
      - Integration test if affects other components
    
    - [ ] **Generate implementation task**
      - Command: `workflow task-generation`
      - Uses: tech-spec.md

    Since this is a Level {{project_level}} game project, you need solutioning for platform/engine architecture.
    
    **Start new chat with solutioning workflow and provide:**
    
    1. This GDD: `{{gdd_output_file}}`
    2. Project analysis: `{{analysis_file}}`
    
    **The solutioning workflow will:**
    
    - Determine game engine/platform (Unity, Godot, Phaser, custom, etc.)
    - Generate solution-architecture.md with engine-specific decisions
    - Create per-epic tech specs
    - Handle platform-specific architecture (from registry.csv game-\* entries)

    ## Cohesion Summary
    
    ### Overall Readiness Assessment
    
    - [ ] **Ready for Development** - All critical items pass
    - [ ] **Needs Alignment** - Some gaps need addressing
    - [ ] **Too Risky** (brownfield only) - Integration risks too high
    
    ### Critical Gaps Identified
    
    _List any blocking issues or unacceptable risks:_
    
    ### Integration Risk Level (brownfield only)
    
    - [ ] Low - well-understood integration with good rollback
    - [ ] Medium - some unknowns but manageable
    - [ ] High - significant risks require mitigation
    
    ### Recommendations
    
    _Specific actions to improve cohesion before development:_
